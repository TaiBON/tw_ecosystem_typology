# SM1 Subterranean tidal biome

The subterranean tidal biome includes coastal pools and subterranean voids with a partially or entirely submerged connection to marine waters. Like all other subterranean ecosystems, sunlight is absent or too dim to sustain photosynthesis. Marine shelf ecosystems (M1), terrestrial aquifers (SF1) and surface coastal systems (T, MT) connected to these subterranean systems are their sources of allochthonous energy, nutrients and oxygenation. Food and energy availability are influenced by in situ microbial processing (biogeochemical transformation) of these allochthonous organic matter inputs. The marine interface, a typical feature of coastal aquifers and subterranean estuaries, also generates a marked salinity gradient is the primary zone of biogeochemical cycling. In carbonate
and volcanic geologies, the salinity gradient can often be observed in the flooded pools, voids, and caves as a halocline (a sharp salinity gradient in the water column), which is not present in other subterranean environments. In comparison
to other subterranean ecosystems, diverse assemblages of chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic microbes, as well as scavengers, filter feeders and predators. Physiological traits enabling osmotic regulation allow some species to transit across haloclines between the fresh- and saline waters. In dark sections of the subterranean marine systems where photoautotrophs are absent, trophic webs are truncated. Some of the subterranean marine biota belong to lineages otherwise restricted to the
deep sea floor (M3), and share traits with those in other low- productivity, dark biomes, including depigmentation, reduced visual organs, increased tactile and chemical sensitivity, low fecundity, long lifespans, and slow metabolism and growth
rates. Tides are an important means of hydrological mixing, resource flux, biotic dispersal and perturbation. In subterranean tidal systems with more direct connections to the sea, marine suspension feeders, particularly sponges and other sessile invertebrates, are dominant. Farther into marine and anchialine caves, where tidal flushing and water exchange diminishes
or disappears, the fauna consists of stygobitic crustaceans, annelids and several other faunal groups (i.e. strictly subterranean aquatic fauna that complete their entire life in this environment).

# SM1.1 Anchialine caves

BIOME: SM1 SUBTERRANEAN TIDAL SYSTEMS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL SUBTERRANEAN-MARINE


## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Anchialine caves contain bodies
of saline or brackish waters with subterranean connections to the sea. Since virtually all anchialine biota are marine in origin, these caves have a larger and more diverse species pool than underground freshwaters. The trophic network is truncated
and dominated by heterotrophs (scavenging and filter-feeding detritivores and their predators), with photosynthetic primary producers and herbivores only present where sinkholes connect caves to the surface and sunlight. Productivity is limited by the scarcity of light and food, but less so than in insular freshwater subterranean systems (SF1.1) due to influx of marine detritus and biota. The dominant fauna includes planktonic bacteria, protozoans, annelids, crustaceans and fish. Anchialine obligates that inhabit locations deep within the caves, with marine biota increasing in frequency with proximity to the sea. Caves closely connected with the ocean tend to have stronger tidal currents and biota, such as sponges and hydroids commonly associated with sea caves (SM1.3). Distinctive traits of cave obligates
that reflect selection under darkness and food scarcity include varying degrees of eye loss and depigmentation, increased tactile and chemical sensitivity, reproduction with few large eggs, long lifespans, and slow metabolism and growth rates. Some anchialine biota are related to in deep sea species, including shrimps that retain red pigmentation, while others include relict taxa inhabiting anchialine caves on opposite sides of ocean basins. Characteristic anchialine taxa also occur in isolated water bodies, far within extensive seafloor cave systems.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Anchialine caves originate from seawater penetration into faults, fractures, and lava tubes as well as sea-level rise into limestone caves formed by solution. Cave waters are characterised by an absence or scarcity of light, low food abundance and strong salinity gradients. Sharp haloclines, which fluctuate with tides and rainfall percolation, occur at deeper depths with increasing distance inland. Tidal connections result in suck and blow phases of water movement that diminish with increasing distance from the sea. In karst terrain with no surface runoff, anchialine caves are closely linked
via hydrology to overlying subaerial coastal systems and can serve as subterranean rivers with haloclines separating seaward flowing freshwater from underlying saltwater. Temperatures are moderate, increasing at the halocline, then stabilise with depth. Dissolved oxygen declines with depth.

## DISTRIBUTION

Scattered worldwide, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere in limestone, basalt flows, and more rarely other lithic substrates.

# SM1.2 Anchialine pools

BIOME: SM1 SUBTERRANEAN TIDAL SYSTEMS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL SUBTERRANEAN-MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Anchialine pools, like anchialine caves (SM1.1), are tidally influenced bodies of brackish water with subterranean connections to the sea and groundwater, but with significant or full exposure to open air and sunlight. They have no surface connection to the ocean or freshwater ecosystems. Younger anchialine pools are exposed to abundant sunlight, characterised by relatively low productivity, and tend to support only benthic microalgae, cyanobacteria and primary consumers. Older pools with more established biological communities have higher productivity with a wider range of autotrophs, including macroalgae, aquatic monocots, established riparian and canopy vegetation, and primary
and secondary consumers. High productivity is attributed to
a combination of sunlight exposure, rugose substrates and relatively high natural concentrations of inorganic nutrients from groundwater. Anchialine pools may support complex benthic microbial communities, primary consumers, filter-feeders, detritivores, scavengers and secondary consumers. These consumers are primarily molluscs and crustaceans, several of which are anchialine obligates. Due to connections with deeper hypogeal habitats, obligate species may display physical and physiological traits similar to anchialine cave species. However, larger predatory fish and birds also utilize anchialine pools for food and habitat. Anchialine pools are ecologically dynamic systems due to their openness, connections with surrounding terrestrial habitats and subterranean hydrologic connections. Consequently, they are inherently sensitive to ecological phase shifts throughout their relatively ephemeral existence, with senescence initiating in as little as 100 years. However, new anchialine pools may form within a few months after basaltic lava flows.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Anchialine pools form from subterranean mixing of seawater and groundwater, primarily through porous basalt or limestone substrates, and more rarely other lithic substrates. Tidal influences can drive large fluctuations in water level and salinity on a daily cycle, but are typically dampened with increased distance from the ocean. Sunlight, UV exposure and other environmental characteristics vary within anchialine pools and haloclines are common. The pools can also be connected to anchialine cave systems (SM1.1) through tension fissures in basalt flows, and collapsed openings in lava tubes.

## DISTRIBUTION

Scattered worldwide, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. Many well- known examples occur in Hawaii, Palau and Indonesia, volcanic cracks or grietas in the Galapagos Islands, and open-air entrance pools of anchialine caves (e.g. cenotes in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and blue holes in the Bahamas).

# SM1.3 Sea caves

BIOME: SM1 SUBTERRANEAN TIDAL SYSTEMS.
REALM: TRANSITIONAL SUBTERRANEAN-MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Sea caves (also known as marine
or littoral caves) are usually formed by wave action abrasion in various rock types. In contrast to anchialine caves (SM1.1), sea caves are not isolated from the external marine environment. Thus, the biota in sea caves are mostly stygophiles (typical of dim-light cryptic and deep-water environments outside caves) or stygoxenes (species sheltering in caves during daytime but foraging outside at night). However, numerous taxa (mostly sessile invertebrates) have so far been reported only from sea caves, and thus can be considered as cave-exclusive sensu lato. Visitors often enter sea caves by chance (i.e. carried in by currents), and survive only for short periods. The diverse sea- cave biota is dominated by sessile (e.g. sponges, cnidarians, bryozoans) and mobile invertebrates (i.e. molluscs crustaceans, annelids) and fish. Photoautotrophs are restricted close to cave openings, while chemoautotrophic bacteria form extensive mats in sea caves with hydrothermal sulphur springs, similar
to those in some terrestrial caves (SF1.1) and deep sea vents (M3.7). In semi-dark and dark cave sectors, the main trophic categories are filter-feeders (passive and active), detritivores, carnivores, and omnivores. Decomposers also play important roles. Filter-feeders consume plankton and suspended organic material delivered by tidal currents and waves. Other organisms either feed on organic material produced by filter-feeders
or move outside caves in to find food. These “migrants”, especially swarm-forming crustaceans and schooling fish can be significant import pathways for organic matter, mitigating oligotrophy in confined cave sectors.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Sea caves openings vary from fully submerged and never exposed to the atmosphere
to partially submerged and exposed to waves and tides. Sea caves are generally shorter and receive less input of freshwater from terrestrial sources than anchialine caves (SM1.1). Sea caves thus lack haloclines, a defining feature of anchialine caves, and are influenced more strongly by marine waters and biota throughout their extent. While salinity gradients are weak, the decrease of light and sea water renewal from the opening to the cave interior drive marked zonation of biota by creating oligotrophic conditions and limiting larval supply. Submersion level, cave morphology and micro-topography play key roles in forming such gradients.

## DISTRIBUTION

Globally distributed in coastal headlands, rocky reefs and in coral reefs.
