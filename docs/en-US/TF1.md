# TF1 Palustrine wetlands biome

At the interface of terrestrial and freshwater realms, the Palustrine wetlands biome includes vegetated floodplains, groundwater seeps, and mires with permanent or intermittent surface water. Although water and light are abundant at
least periodically, saturation of the soil may result in oxygen deprivation below the ground. This suppresses microbial activity and, in many systems, production exceeds decomposition, resulting in peat accumulation. The water regime influences resource availability and productivity and thus regulates
these ecosystems from the bottom-up. Interactions among catchment precipitation, local evapotranspiration, and substrate and surface morphology regulate run-on, runoff, infiltration,
and percolation. This results in water regimes that vary from permanent shallow standing water or near-surface water tables to seasonally high water tables to episodic inundation with long inter-annual dry phases. As a consequence of their indirect relationships with climate, wetland biomes are traditionally classified as ‘azonal’. Spatial heterogeneity is a key feature of palustrine wetlands. At landscape scales, they function as resource sinks and refuges with substantially higher productivity than the surrounding matrix. Fine-scale spatial variation in the water regime often produces restricted hydrological niches
and intricate mosaics of patch types with contrasting structure and biotic composition. Autotrophs dominate complex trophic webs. Amphibious macrophytes are the dominant autotrophs, although epibenthic algae are important in some systems. Amphibious plants have specialised traits enabling growth and survival in low-oxygen substrates and often engineer habitats for heterotrophs. Microbial decomposers and invertebrate detritivores are most abundant in surface soils. A range of microscopic and macroinvertebrates with sedentary adult phases (i.e. crustaceans) have obligate associations with Palustrine wetlands, which also provide important foraging and breeding sites for macroinvertebrate and vertebrate herbivores and predators that disperse more widely across the landscape, including waterbirds.

# TF1.1 Tropical flooded forests and peat forests

BIOME: TF1 PALUSTRINE WETLANDS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Closed-canopy forests in tropical swamps and riparian zones have high biomass and LAI, with unseasonal growth and reproductive phenology. The canopy foliage is evergreen, varying in size from mesophyll to notophyll with moderate SLA. Productivity differs markedly between high-nutrient ‘white water’ riparian systems and low-nutrient ‘black water’ systems. In the latter, most of the nutrient capital is sequestered in plant biomass, litter, or peat, whereas in white water systems, soil nutrients are replenished continually by fluvial subsidies. Some trees have specialised traits conferring tolerance to low-oxygen substrates, such as surface root
mats, pneumatophores and stilt roots. Palms (sometimes in pure stands), hydrophytes, pitcher plants, epiphytic mosses, and ferns may be abundant, but lianas and grasses are rare or absent. The recent origin of these forests has allowed limited time for evolutionary divergence from nearby lowland rainforests (T1.1), but strong filtering by saturated soils has resulted in low diversity and some endemism. The biota is spatially structured by local hydrological gradients. Riparian galleries of floodplain forests also occur within savanna matrices. Trophic networks are complex but with less diverse representation of vertebrate consumers and predators than T1.1, although avian frugivores, primates, amphibians, macroinvertebrates, and crocodilian predators are prominent. Plant propagules are dispersed mostly by surface water or vertebrates. Seed dormancy and seedbanks are rare. Gap-phase dynamics are driven by individual tree-
fall, storm events, or floods in riparian forests, but many plants exhibit leaf-form plasticity and can recruit in the shade.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

High rainfall, overbank flows or high water tables maintain an abundant water supply. Continual soil profile saturation leads to anaerobic black water conditions and peat accumulation. In contrast, white water riparian zones undergo frequent fluvial disturbance and drain rapidly. Peat forests often develop behind lake shore vegetation or mangroves, which block lateral drainage. Black water peatlands may become domed, ombrogenous (i.e. rain-dependent), highly acidic, and nutrient-poor, with peat accumulating to depths of 20 m. In contrast, white water riparian forests are less permanently inundated and floods continually replenish nutrients, disturb vegetation, and rework sediments. Hummock-hollow micro-topography is characteristic of all forested wetlands and contributes to niche diversity. Light may be limited by dense tree canopies. There is low diurnal, intra- and inter-annual variability in rainfall and temperature, with the latter rarely &lt;10°C, which promotes microbial activity when oxygen is available.

## DISTRIBUTION

Flat equatorial lowlands of Southeast Asia, South America, and Central and West Africa, notably in Borneo and the Amazonian lowlands.

# TF1.2 Subtropical-temperate forested wetlands

BIOME: TF1 PALUSTRINE WETLANDS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These hydrophilic forests and thickets have an open to closed tree or shrub canopy, 2–40 m tall, dependent on flood regimes or groundwater lenses. Unlike tropical forests (TF1.1), they typically are dominated by one
or very few woody species. Trees engineer fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in resource availability (water, nutrients, and
light) and ecosystem structure, which affects the composition, form, and functional traits of understorey plants and fauna. Engineering processes include the alteration of sediments,
(i.e. surface micro-topography by the growth of large roots),
the deposition of leaf litter and woody debris, canopy shading, creation of desiccation refuges for fauna and the development of foraging or nesting substrates (i.e. tree hollows). Forest understories vary from diverse herbaceous assemblages
to simple aquatic macrophyte communities in response to spatial and temporal hydrological gradients, which influence
the density and relative abundance of algae, hydrophytes and dryland plants. Primary production varies seasonally and inter- annually and can be periodically high due to the mobilisation of nutrients on floodplains during inundation. Nutrients accumulate on floodplains during low flows, and may drive microbial blooms, leading to aquatic anoxia, and fish kills, which may be extensive when flushing occurs. Plant and animal life histories are closely connected to inundation (e.g. seed-fall, germination fish-spawning and bird breeding are stimulated by flooding). Inundation-phase aquatic food webs are moderately complex. Turtles, frogs, birds and sometimes fish exploit the alternation between aquatic and terrestrial phases. Waterbirds forage extensively on secondary production, stranded as floodplains recede, and breed in the canopies of trees or mid-storey. Forested wetlands are refuges for many vertebrates during droughts. Itinerant mammalian herbivores (e.g. deer and kangaroos) may have locally important impacts on vegetation structure and recruitment.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These forests occur on floodplains, riparian corridors, and disconnected lowland flats. Seasonally and inter-annually variable water supply influences ecosystem dynamics. Allochthonous water and nutrient subsidies from upstream catchments supplement local resources and promote the extension of floodplain forests and their biota into arid regions (‘green tongues’). Water movement is critical for the connectivity and movement of biota, while some groundwater-dependent forests are disconnected. High-energy floods in riparian corridors displace standing vegetation and woody debris, redistribute nutrients, and create opportunities for dispersal and recruitment. Low-energy environments with slow drainage promote peat accumulation. Extreme drying and heat events may generate episodes of tree dieback and mortality. Fires may occur depending on the frequency of fire weather, ignition sources, and landscape context.

## DISTRIBUTION

Temperate and subtropical floodplains. riparian zones and lowland flats worldwide.

# TF1.3 Permanent marshes 

BIOME: TF1 PALUSTRINE WETLANDS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These shallow, permanently inundated freshwater wetlands lack woody vegetation but
are dominated instead by emergent macrophytes growing
in extensive, often monospecific groves of rhizomatous grasses, sedges, rushes, or reeds in mosaics with patches
of open water. These plants, together with phytoplankton, algal mats, epiphytes, floating, and amphibious herbs, sustain high primary productivity and strong bottom-up regulation. Although most of the energy comes from these functionally diverse autotrophs, inflow and seepage from catchments may contribute allochthonous energy and nutrients. Plant traits, including aerenchymatous stems and leaf tissues (i.e. with
air spaces), enable oxygen transport to roots and rhizomes
and into the substrate. Invertebrate and microbial detritivores and decomposers inhabit the water column and substrate. Air-breathing invertebrates are more common than gill- breathers, due to low dissolved oxygen. The activity of microbial decomposers is also limited by low oxygen levels and organic deposition continually exceeds decomposition. Their aquatic predators include invertebrates, turtles, snakes and sometimes small fish. The emergent vegetation supports a complex trophic web, including insects with winged adult phases, waterbirds, reptiles, and mammals, which feed in the vegetation and
also use it for nesting (e.g. herons, muskrat, and alligators). Waterbirds include herbivores, detritivores, and predators. Many plants and animals disperse widely beyond the marsh through the air, water and zoochory (e.g. birds, mammals). Reproduction and recruitment coincide with resource availability and may be cued to floods. Most macrophytes spread vegetatively with long rhizomes but also produce an abundance of wind- and water- dispersed seeds.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These systems occur in several geomorphic settings, including lake shores, groundwater seeps, river floodplains and deltas, always in low-energy depositional environments. Shallow but perennial inundation and low variability are maintained by frequent floods and lake waters, sometimes independently of local climate. This sustains high levels of water and nutrients, but also generates substrate anoxia. Substrates are typically organic. Their texture varies, but silt and clay substrates are associated with high levels of P and N. Salinity is low but may be transitional where wetlands connect with brackish lagoons (FM1.2, FM1.3). Surface fires may burn vegetation in some permanent marshes, but rarely burn the saturated substrate, and are less pervasive drivers of these ecosystems than seasonal floodplain marshes (TF1.4).

## DISTRIBUTION

Scattered throughout the tropical and temperate regions worldwide.

# TF1.4 Seasonal floodplain marshes

BIOME: TF1 PALUSTRINE WETLANDS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

This group includes high-productivity floodplain wetlands fed regularly by large inputs of allochthonous resources that drive strong bottom-up regulation, and smaller areas of disconnected oligotrophic wetlands. Functionally diverse autotrophs include phytoplankton, algal mats and epiphytes, floating and amphibious herbs and graminoids, and semi-terrestrial woody plants. Interactions of fine-scale spatial gradients in anoxia and desiccation are related to differential flooding. These gradients shape ecosystem assembly by enabling species with diverse life-history traits to exploit different niches, resulting in strong local zonation of vegetation and
high patch-level diversity of habitats for consumers. Wetland mosaics include very productive and often extensive grasses, sedges and forbs (sedges dominate oligotrophic systems)
that persist through dry seasons largely as dormant seeds or subterranean organs as well as groves of woody perennials that are less tolerant of prolonged anoxia but access ground water or arrest growth during dry phases. Productive and functionally diverse autotrophs support complex trophic networks with zooplankton, aquatic invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, aquatic mammals, waterbirds, and terrestrial animals with diverse dietary and foraging strategies. During dry phases, obligate aquatic organisms are confined to wet refugia. Others, including many invertebrates, have dormancy traits allowing persistence during dry phases. Very high abundances and diversities of invertebrates, waterbirds, reptiles, and mammals exploit resource availability, particularly when prey are concentrated during drawdown phases of floods. Reproduction and recruitment, especially of fish, coincide with food availability cued by flood regimes.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Regular seasonal flooding and drying is driven by river flow regimes, reflecting seasonal precipitation or melt patterns in catchments. Salinity gradients and tides influence these marshes where they adjoin estuaries, with brackish marshes on transitions to TF1.2, TF1.3 and MFT1.3. Disconnected oligotrophic systems rely on rainfall and low substrate permeability for seasonal waterlogging. Seasonal flood extent and duration vary inter-annually, especially in temperate zones. Geomorphic heterogeneity in the depositional floodplains promote spatial and temporal variability in moisture status, creating contrasting patches, including perennially inundated refuges and dry ‘islands’ that seldom flood and dry rapidly. Substrates are fertile alluvia or infertile white sands with variable grain sizes, moisture, and organic content that reflect fine-scale depositional patterns and hydrological gradients. Fires may occur in dry seasons, releasing resources, changing vegetation structure and composition, consuming organic substrates and lowering the wetland surface.

## DISTRIBUTION

Throughout the seasonal tropics and subhumid temperate regions of the world.

# TF1.5 Episodic arid floodplains

BIOME: TF1 PALUSTRINE WETLANDS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Highly episodic freshwater floodplains are distinct from, but associated with, adjacent river channels, which provide water and sediment during flooding. These are low-productivity systems during long, dry periods (maybe years), with periodic spikes of very high productivity when first inundated. These floodplains have a high diversity of aquatic and terrestrial biota in complex trophic networks, with ruderal life-history traits enabling the exploitation of transient water and nutrient availability. Primary producers include flood- dependent macrophytes and algae with physiological traits for water conservation or drought avoidance. Lower trophic levels (e.g. algae, invertebrate consumers) avoid desiccation with traits, such as dormant life-cycle phases, deposition of resting eggs (e.g. crustaceans and rotifers) and burial in sediments banks (i.e. larvae of cyclopoid copepods). Higher trophic levels (e.g. fish, amphibians, reptiles and waterbirds) are highly mobile in large numbers or with resting strategies (i.e. burrowing frogs). These taxa can be important mobile links for the movement of biota and resources, but floods are the primary allochthonous sources of energy and nutrients. Floods are important
triggers for life-history processes, such as seed germination, emergence from larval stages, dispersal and reproduction. Common lifeforms include detritus-feeding invertebrate collector-gatherers, indicating a reliance on heterotrophic energy pathways.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Multi-year dry periods are punctuated by brief intervals of shallow inundation caused by the overspill from flooding river channels. These boom-bust systems have temporarily high productivity driven by water and partly by elevated levels of dissolved Carbon and nutrients (notably N and P) released from leaf litter, oxygen, and organic matter in newly inundated, shallow areas. High temperatures promote productivity and rapid drying in arid environments. Water may be turbid or clear, which affects light environments and may limit benthic algal production to the shallow littoral margins of small channels. This in turn affects aquatic food webs and Carbon dynamics. Drainage is predominantly horizontal
and bidirectional (i.e. in and out of the river), but infiltration and evapotranspiration can be significant in the flat terrain and may influence salinity if there are sources of salt in the catchment or ground water.

## DISTRIBUTION

Connected to ephemeral rivers in semi-arid and arid regions of all continents.

# TF1.6 Boreal, temperate and montane peat bogs

BIOME: TF1 PALUSTRINE WETLANDS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These patterned peatlands account for up to 40% of global soil carbon are dominated by a dense cover (high LAI) of hydrophytic mosses, graminoids, and shrubs, sometimes with scattered trees. Positive feedbacks between dense ground vegetation, hydrology, and substrate chemistry promote peat formation. through water retention and inhibition of microbial decomposition. Moderate to low primary production is partially broken down at the soil surface by anamorphic
fungi and aerobic bacteria. Burial by overgrowth and saturation by the water table promotes anaerobic conditions, limiting subsurface microbial activity, while acidity, nutrient scarcity, and low temperatures enhance the excess of organic deposition over decomposition. Plant diversity is low but fine-scale hydrological gradients structure vegetation mosaics, which may include fens (TF1.7). Mosses (notably Sphagnum spp.) and graminoids with layering growth forms promote peat formation. Their relative abundance influences microbial communities and peat biochemistry. Plant traits, such as lacunate stem tissues, aerenchyma and surface root mats, promote oxygen transport into the anaerobic substrate. Woody plant foliage is small (leptophyll-microphyll) and sclerophyllous, reflecting excess carbohydrate production in low-nutrient conditions. Plants and fungi reproduce primarily by cloning,
except where disturbances (i.e. fires) initiate gaps enabling recruitment. Pools within the bogs have specialised aquatic food webs underpinned by algal production and allochthonous carbon. Invertebrate larvae are prominent consumers in the trophic network of bog pools, and as adults they are important pollinators and predators. Assemblages of flies, dragonflies, damselflies, caddisflies and other invertebrates vary with the number, size and stability of pools. Carnivorous plants (i.e. sundews) support N cycling. Vertebrates are mostly itinerant but include specialised resident amphibians, reptiles, rodents, and birds. Some regions are rich in locally endemic flora and fauna, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Bogs are restricted to cool humid climates where moisture inputs (e.g. precipitation, seepage, and surface inflow) exceed outputs (e.g. evapotranspiration, percolation and runoff) for extended periods, enabling these systems to function as landscape sponges. Seasonally low temperatures and/or frequent cloud cover limit evapotranspiration. Substrates are waterlogged, anaerobic, highly organic (usually &gt;30% dry weight), acidic (pH 3.5–6), and nutrient-poor. Peat growth may produce raised ombrotrophic bogs entirely fed by rain, but if minerotrophic inflows from catchments occur, they provide limited nutrient subsidies (cf. TF1.6). Fires may occur in dry summers, sometimes igniting peat with long-term consequences for ecosystem function and stability.

## DISTRIBUTION

Extensive across boreal-subarctic latitudes, with small areas on tropical mountains of South America, New Guinea, and Central Africa and at cool, temperate southern latitudes in Patagonia and Australasia.

# TF1.7 Boreal and temperate fens 

BIOME: TF1 PALUSTRINE WETLANDS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Fens are peatland ecosystems dominated by hydrophytic grasses, sedges, or forbs. Fens
have higher productivity but lower functional diversity than bogs (TF1.6). Productivity is subsidised by inflow of minerotrophic waters and limited by anoxic substrates. Plant diversity is
very low where surface hydrology varies temporally from complete saturation to desiccation but can be high in mineral- rich fens with stable near-surface water tables. Some regions
are rich in locally endemic flora and fauna. Woody plants
are typically scarce or absent, though some boreal forests
(T2.1) develop on minerotrophic peats. Sphagnum mosses
and hummock-forming sedges are absent from rich fens but ‘brown mosses’ are common. Primary production is partly broken down on soil-surface layers by anamorphic fungi and aerobic bacteria. Anaerobic conditions due to high water tables limit subsurface microbial activity so that organic deposition exceeds decomposition and peat accumulates. Plant traits,
such as lacunate stem tissues, aerenchyma and surface root mats, promote oxygen transport into the anaerobic substrate. Methanogenic archaea and anaerobic bacteria may occur in the subsoil if N, Fe and S are sufficient to sustain them. Fens may
be spatially homogeneous or form string mosaics with bogs
(i.e. aapa mires of Finland) but often display zonation reflecting differences in water chemistry (notably pH) or saturation. Patches of fen and bogs may be juxtaposed within peatland mosaics. Ongoing peat build-up may lead to transition from fen to bog systems. Plants and fungi reproduce locally by cloning, but seed and spore production enables dispersal and the colonisation
of new sites. Invertebrates are dominant consumers in the trophic network, including dragonflies, caddisflies, flies, as well as calcareous specialists such as snails. Vertebrates are mostly itinerant but include specialised resident amphibians and birds.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Moisture inputs (e.g. precipitation, seepage, and surface inflow) exceed outputs (e.g. evapotranspiration, percolation and runoff) for extended periods, enabling these systems to function as landscape sponges. Seasonally low temperatures and/or frequent cloud cover limit evapotranspiration. Fens typically develop through the paludification (i.e. peat accumulation) of shallow lakes or around springs, and thus shallow standing water is present frequently
as flark pools. Such lakes may be abundant in post-glacial landscapes. Substrates are waterlogged, anaerobic, highly organic (usually &gt;30% dry weight), slightly acidic or alkaline, and rich in mineral nutrients. Minerotrophic water (i.e. inflow from catchments) provides significant nutrient subsidies that vary with catchment geology. Fens on the Arctic Circle (palsa mires) have subsurface permafrost. Fires may occur in dry summers, rarely consuming peat, lowering the surface and degrading permafrost.

## DISTRIBUTION

Extensive across boreal-subarctic latitudes and cool temperate regions, especially mountains. Very restricted in the Southern Hemisphere. Fens may also occur in tropical mountains (i.e. Andes), but are poorly known there.
