The Deep-sea floor covers the entire oceanic benthos below ~250 m deep, where there is not enough light to support primary productivity through photosynthesis. It extends from the upper bathyal seafloor to the deepest parts of the ocean, at just under 11 km in the Mariana Trench. Most deep-sea communities are therefore heterotrophic, depending ultimately on allochthonous energy and nutrients from the vertical flux and/or advection down-slopes of organic matter produced in the upper photic layers of ocean waters. Chemosynthetically- based ecosystems, such as those found at hydrothermal
vents and cold seeps, are an exception, as chemoautotrophic microorganisms synthesise reduced compounds (i.e. hydrogen sulphide and methane) in hydrothermal and cold-seep fluids as autochthonous source of energy. Oxygen is not limiting due to global-scale thermohaline circulation via deep ocean currents, except in bathyal (200 m–1,000 m) areas along the eastern Pacific, southwestern Africa, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where physical and biological processes result in the formation of oxygen-minimum zones. Depth generates a strong
gradient in hydrostatic pressure, increasing one atmosphere with every 10 m in depth, excluding fish from depths >8.5 km. Currents, geomorphology and substrate type also influence ecosystem function. Geomorphology differentiates several functional groups of ecosystems within the deep seafloor biome because of its influence on both the movement of currents and the vertical flux of resources, with marine canyons, seamounts and trenches creating resource-rich hotspots. Extensive soft sediments on the abyssal plains support burrowing detritivores and predators, whereas sessile suspension feeders dominate hard substrates. Deep-sea benthic biodiversity is usually very high and mostly composed of meio-fauna and macro-fauna, with high abundances of microbes. Chemosynthetically-based ecosystems are exceptional again, as their biota is characterised by high biomass, low diversity and high endemism. Organisms are equipped with traits that enable survival in the absence of light, high hydrostatic pressure, and low levels of nutrients and carbon.

# M3.1 Continental and island slopes

BIOME: M3 DEEP SEA FLOORS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These aphotic heterotrophic ecosystems fringe the margins of continental plates and islands, extending from the shelf break (~250 m deep) to the abyssal basins (4,000 m). These large sedimentary slopes with localised rocky outcrops are characterised by strong depth gradients in the biota and may be juxtaposed with specialised ecosystems, such as submarine canyons (M3.2), deep-water biogenic systems (M3.6) and chemosynthetic seeps (M3.7), as well as landslides and oxygen-minimum zones. Energy sources are derived mostly from lateral advection from the shelf and vertical fallout of organic matter particles through the water column and pelagic fauna impinging on the slopes, which varies seasonally with the productivity of the euphotic layers. Other inputs of organic matter include sporadic pulses of large falls (e.g. whale falls and wood falls). Photoautotrophs and resident herbivores are absent, and the trophic network is dominated by microbial decomposers, detritivores and their predators. Depth-related gradients result in a marked bathymetric zonation of faunal communities, and there is significant basin-scale endemism in many taxa. The taxonomic diversity of these heterotrophs is high and reaches a maximum at middle to lower depths. The biomass of megafauna decreases with depth and the meio- fauna and macro-fauna become relatively more important, but maximum biomass occurs on mid-slopes in some regions. The megafauna is often characterised by sparse populations of detritivores, including echinoderms, crustaceans and demersal fish, but sessile benthic organisms are scarce and the bottom is typically bare, unconsolidated sediments.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The continental
slopes are characterised by strong environmental depth gradients in pressure, temperature, light and food. Limited sunlight penetration permits some visual predation but no photosynthesis below 250 m and rapidly diminishes with depth, with total darkness (excluding bioluminescence) below 1,000
m. Hydrostatic pressure increases with depth (one atmosphere every 10 m). Temperature drastically shifts below the thermocline from warmer surface waters to cold, deep water (1–3°C), except in the Mediterranean Sea (13°C) and the Red Sea (21°C).
Food quantity and quality decrease with increasing depth, as heterotrophic zooplankton efficiently use the labile compounds of the descending particulate organic matter. Sediments on continental slopes provide important ecosystem services, including nutrient regeneration and carbon sequestration.

## DISTRIBUTION

Fringing the margins of all ocean basins and oceanic islands. Extending beneath 11% of the ocean surface at depths of 250–4,000 m.

# M3.2 Submarine canyons

BIOME: M3 DEEP SEA FLOORS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Submarine canyons are major geomorphic features that function as dynamic flux routes for resources between continental shelves and ocean basins.
As a result, canyons are one of the most productive and biodiverse habitats in the deep sea. Habitat heterogeneity and temporal variability are key features of submarine canyons, with the diversity of topographic and hydrodynamic features and substrate types (e.g. mud, sand and rocky walls) within and among canyons contributing to their highly diverse heterotrophic faunal assemblages. Photoautotrophs are present only at the heads of some canyons. Canyons are characterised by meio-, macro-, and mega-fauna assemblages with greater abundances and/or biomass than adjacent continental slopes (M3.1) due mainly to the greater quality and quantity of food inside canyon systems. Habitat complexity and high resource availability
make canyons important refuges, nurseries, spawning areas and regional source populations for fish, crustaceans and other benthic biota. Steep exposed rock and strong currents may facilitate the development of dense communities of sessile predators and filter-feeders, such as cold-water corals and sponges, engineering complex three-dimensional habitats. Soft substrates favour high densities of pennatulids and detritivores such as echinoderms. The role of canyons as centres of carbon deposition makes them an extraordinary habitat for deep-sea deposit-feeders, which represent the dominant mobile benthic trophic guild. The high productivity attracts pelagic-associated secondary and tertiary consumers, including cetaceans, which may visit canyons for feeding and breeding.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Submarine canyons
vary in their origin, length, depth range (mean: 2,000 m), hydrodynamics, sedimentation patterns and biota. Their complex topography modifies regional currents, inducing local upwelling, downwelling and other complex hydrodynamic processes (e.g. turbidity currents, dense shelf water cascading and internal waves). Through these processes, canyons act
as geomorphic conduits of water masses, sediments and organic matter from the productive coastal shelf to deep basins. This is particularly evident in shelf-incising canyons directly affected by riverine inputs and other coastal processes. Complex hydrodynamic patterns enhance nutrient levels and food inputs mostly through downward lateral advection, but also by local upwelling, active biological transport by vertical migration of organisms and passive fall of organic flux of varied particles sizes. Differences among canyons are driven primarily by variation in the abundance and quality of food sources,
as well as finer-scale drivers, including the variability of water mass structure (i.e. turbidity, temperature, salinity and oxygen gradients), seabed geomorphology, depth and substratum.

## DISTRIBUTION

Submarine canyons cover 11.2% of continental slopes, with 9,000 large canyons recorded globally. Most of their extent is distributed below 200 m, with a mean depth of 2,000 m.

# M3.3 Abyssal plains

BIOME: M3 DEEP SEA FLOORS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

This is the largest group of benthic marine ecosystems, extending between 3,000 and 6,000
m deep and covered by thick layers (up to thousands of metres) of fine sediment. Less than 1% of the seafloor has been investigated biologically. Tests of giant protozoans and the lebensspuren (i.e. tracks, borrows and mounds) made
by megafauna structure the habitats of smaller organisms. Ecosystem engineering aside, other biotic interactions among large fauna are weak due to the low densities of organisms. Abyssal communities are heterotrophic, with energy sources derived mostly from the fallout of organic matter particles through the water column. Large carrion falls are major local inputs of organic matter and can later become important chemosynthetic environments (M3.7). Seasonal variation in particulate organic matter flux reflects temporal patterns in the productivity of euphotic layers. Input of organic matter can also be through sporadic pulses of large falls (e.g. whale falls and wood falls). Most abyssal plains are food-limited and the quantity and quality of food input to the abyssal seafloor are strong drivers shaping the structure and function of abyssal communities. Abyssal biomass is very low and dominated
by meio-fauna and microorganisms that play key roles in the function of benthic communities below 3,000 m deep. The abyssal biota, however, is highly diverse, mostly composed of macro- and meio-fauna with large numbers of species new
to science (up to 80% in some regions). Many species have
so far been sampled only as singletons (only one specimen
per species) or as a few specimens. The megafauna is often characterised by sparse populations of detritivores, notably echinoderms, crustaceans and demersal fish. Species distribution and major functions, such as community respiration and bioturbation, are linked to particulate organic carbon flux. These functions modulate the important ecosystem services provided by abyssal plains, including nutrient regeneration and carbon sequestration.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

No light penetrates to abyssal depths. Hydrostatic pressure is very high (300–600 atmospheres). Water masses above abyssal plains are well oxygenated and characterised by low temperatures -0.5–3°C), except in the Mediterranean Sea (13°C) and the Red Sea (21°C). The main driver of most abyssal communities is food, which mostly arrives to the seafloor as particulate organic carbon or ‘marine snow’. Only 0.5–2% of the primary production in the euphotic zone reaches the abyssal seafloor, with the quantity decreasing with increasing depth.

## DISTRIBUTION

Seafloor of all oceans between 3,000 and 6,000 m deep, accounting for 76% of the total seafloor area, segmented by mid-ocean ridges, island arcs and trenches.

# M3.4 Seamounts, ridges and plateaus

BIOME: M3 DEEP SEA FLOORS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Seamounts, plateaus and ridges are major geomorphic features of the deep oceanic seafloor, characterised by hard substrates, elevated topography
and often higher productivity than surrounding waters. Topographically modified currents affect geochemical cycles, nutrient mixing processes and detrital fallout from the euphotic zone that deliver allochthonous energy and nutrients to these heterotroph-dominated systems. Suspension-feeders and
their dependents and predators dominate the trophic web, whereas deposit-feeders and mixed-feeders are less abundant than in other deep-sea systems. Autotrophs are generally absent. Summits that reach the euphotic zone are included within functional groups of the Marine shelf biome. Bathymetric gradients and local substrate heterogeneity support marked variation in diversity, composition and abundance. Rocky walls, for example, may be dominated by sessile suspension-feeders, including cnidarians (especially corals), sponges, crinoids and ascidians. High densities of sessile animals may form deep- water biogenic beds (M3.5), but those systems are not limited to seamounts or ridges. Among the mobile benthic fauna, molluscs and echinoderms can be abundant. Seamounts also support dense aggregations of large fish, attracted by the high secondary productivity of lower trophic levels in the system, as well as spawning and/or nursery habitats. Elevated topography affects the distribution of both benthic and pelagic fauna. Seamounts and ridges tend to act both as stepping stones for the dispersal of slope-dwelling biota and as dispersal barriers between adjacent basins, while insular seamounts may have high endemism.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Seamounts, rising more than 1,000 m above the sediment-covered seabed, and smaller peaks, knobs and hills are topographically isolated features, ostly of volcanic origin. Mid-ocean ridges are semi-continuous mountain chains that mark the spreading margins of adjacent tectonic plates. These prominent topographic formations interact with water masses and currents, increasing turbulence, mixing, particle retention, and the upward movement of nutrients from large areas of the seafloor. This enhances productivity on the seamounts and ridges themselves and also in the euphotic zone above, some of which returns to the system through detrital fallout. A diversity of topographic, bathymetric, and hydrodynamic features and substrate types (e.g. steep rocky walls, flat muddy areas and biogenic habitats at varied depths) contribute to niche diversity and biodiversity. Major bathymetric clines associated with elevated topography produce gradients that shape ecological traits, including species richness, community structure, abundance, biomass and trophic modes.

## DISTRIBUTION

About 171,000 seamounts, knolls and hills documented so far worldwide, covering ~2.6% of the sea floor. Ridges cover ~9.2% of the sea floor along a semi-continuous, 55,000-km long system.

# M3.5 Deepwater biogenic beds

BIOME: M3 DEEP SEA FLOORS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Benthic, sessile suspension-feeders, such as aphotic corals, sponges and bivalves, form structurally complex, three-dimensional structures or ‘animal forests’ in the deep oceans. In contrast to their shallow-water counterparts in coastal and shelf systems (M1.5), these ecosystems are aphotic and rely on allochthonous energy sources borne in currents and pelagic fallout. The trophic web is dominated by filter-feeders, decomposers, detritivores and predators. Primary producers and associated herbivores are only present at the interface with the photic zone (~250 m deep). The biogenic structures are slow growing but critical to local demersal biota in engineering shelter from predators and currents, particularly in shallower, more dynamic waters. They also provide stable substrates and enhance food availability. This habitat heterogeneity becomes more important with depth as stable, complex elevated substrate becomes increasingly limited. These structures and the microenvironments within them support a high diversity
of associated species, including symbionts, microorganisms
in coral biofilm, filter-feeding epifauna, biofilm grazers, mobile predators (e.g. polychaetes and crustaceans) and benthic demersal fish. Diversity is positively related to the size, flexibility and structural complexity of habitat-forming organisms. Their impact on hydrography and the flow of local currents increases retention of particulate matter, zooplankton, eggs and larvae from the water column. This creates positive conditions for suspension-feeders, which engineer their environment and play important roles in benthic-pelagic coupling, increasing the flux of matter and energy from the water column to the benthic community.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The productivity of surface water, the vertical flux of nutrients, water temperature and hydrography influence the availability of food, and hence the distribution and function of deep-water biogenic beds. Although these systems occur on both hard and soft substrates, the latter are less structurally complex and less diverse. Chemical processes are important and ocean acidity is limiting. The presence of cold-water corals, for example, has been linked to the depth of aragonite saturation. Habitat-forming species prefer regions characterised by oxygenation and currents or high flow, generally avoiding oxygen-minimum zones. Benthic biogenic structures and their dependents are highly dependent on low levels of physical disturbance due to slow growth rates and recovery times.

## DISTRIBUTION

Patchy but widespread distribution across the deep sea floor below 250 m deep. Poorly explored and possibly less common on abyssal plains.

# M3.6 Hadal trenches and troughs

BIOME: M3 DEEP SEA FLOORS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Hadal zones are the deepest ocean systems on earth and among the least explored. They are heterotrophic, with energy derived from the fallout of particulate organic matter through the water column, which varies seasonally and geographically and accumulates in the deepest axes of the trenches. Most organic matter reaching hadal depths is nutrient-poor because pelagic organisms use the labile compounds from the particulate organic matter during fallout. Hadal systems are therefore food-limited, but particulate organic matter flux may be boosted by sporadic pulses (e.g. whale falls and wood falls) and sediment transported by advection and seismically induced submarine landslides. Additional energy
is contributed by chemosynthetic bacteria that can establish symbiotic relationships with specialised fauna. These are poorly known but more are expected to be discovered in the future. Hadal trophic networks are dominated by scavengers and detritivores, although predators (including through cannibalism) are also represented. Over 400 species are currently known from hadal ecosystems, with most metazoan taxa represented, including amphipods, polychaetes, gastropods, bivalves, holothurians and fish. These species possess physiological adaptations to high hydrostatic pressure, darkness, low temperature, and low food supply. These environmental filters, together with habitat isolation, result in high levels of endemism. Gigantism in amphipods, mysids and isopods contrasts with the dwarfism in meio-fauna (e.g. nematodes, copepods and kinorhynchs).

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The hadal benthic zone extends from 6,000 to 11,000 m deep and includes 27 disjoint deep-ocean trenches, 13 troughs and 7 faults. Sunlight
is absent, nutrients and organic carbon are scarce, and hydrostatic pressure is extremely high (600–1,100 atmospheres).
Water masses in trenches and troughs are well oxygenated by deep currents and experience constant, low temperatures (1.5– 2.5°C). Rocky substrates outcrop on steep slopes of trenches and faults, while the floors comprise large accumulations of
fine sediment deposited by mass movement, including drift and landslides, which are important sources of organic matter. Sediment, organic matter and pollutants tend to be ‘funnelled’ and concentrated in the axis of the trenches.

## DISTRIBUTION

A cluster of isolated trenches in subduction zones, faults, and troughs or basins, mostly in the Pacific Ocean, as well as the Indian and Southern Oceans, accounting for 1–2% of the total global benthic area.

# M3.7 Chemosynthetic-based ecosystems (CBEs)

BIOME: M3 DEEP SEA FLOORS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Chemosynthetic-based ecosystems (CBEs) include three major types of habitats between bathyal and abyssal depths: 1) hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean ridges, back-arc basins, and active seamounts; 2) cold seeps on active and passive continental margins; and 3) large organic falls of whales or wood. All these systems are characterised
by microbial primary productivity through chemoautotrophy, which uses reduced compounds (such as H2S and CH4)
as energy sources instead of light. Microbes form bacterial
mats and occur in trophic symbiosis with most megafauna.
The continuous sources of energy and microbial symbiosis
fuel high faunal biomass. However, specific environmental factors (e.g. high temperature gradients at vents, chemical toxicity and symbiosis dependence) result in a low diversity and high endemism of highly specialised fauna. Habitat structure comprises hard substrate on vent chimneys and mostly biogenic substrate at seeps and food-falls. Most fauna is sessile or with low motility and depends on the fluids emanating at vents and seeps or chemicals produced by microbes on food-falls, and thus is spatially limited. Large tubeworms, shrimps, crabs, bivalves and gastropods dominate many hydrothermal vents, with marked biogeographic provinces. Tubeworms, mussels and decapod crustaceans often dominate cold seeps with demersal fish. These are patchy ecosystems where connectivity relies on the dispersal of planktonic larvae.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

No light penetrates to deep-sea CBEs. Hydrostatic pressure is very high (30–600 atmospheres). At hydrothermal vents, very hot fluids (up to 400°C) emanate from chimneys charged with metals and chemicals that provide energy to chemoautotrophic microbes. At cold seeps, the fluids are cold and reduced chemicals originate both biogenically and abiotically. At food-falls, reduced chemicals are produced by microorganisms degrading the organic matter of the fall. The main drivers of CBEs are the chemosynthetically based primary productivity and the symbiotic relationships between microorganisms and fauna.

## DISTRIBUTION

Seafloor of all oceans. Vents (map) occur on mid-ocean ridges, back-arc basins and active seamounts. Cold seeps occur on active and passive continental margins. Food- falls occur mostly along cetacean migration routes (whale falls).
