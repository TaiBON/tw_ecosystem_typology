# T2 Temperate-boreal forests and woodlands biome

Temperate-boreal forests and woodlands biome include moderate to highly productive tree-dominated systems with
a wide range of physiognomic and structural expressions distributed from warm-temperate to boreal latitudes. Although generally less diverse than Tropical-subtropical forests (T1)
in taxa such as flowering plants, primates, and birds, these Temperate-boreal forests exhibit greater temporal and spatial variability in productivity, biomass, phenology, and leaf traits
of trees. Temporal variability is expressed primarily through seasonal variation in water balance and/or temperature, which regulate the length and timing of growing and breeding seasons. Inter-annual variation is usually less important than in some other biomes (i.e. T5), but nonetheless may play significant roles in resource availability and disturbance regimes (e.g. fire and storms). Gradients in minimum temperatures, soil nutrients, and fire regimes differentiate ecosystem functional groups within this biome. These influence traits such as leaf form (broadleaf
vs. needleleaf), leaf phenology (evergreen vs. deciduous), ecophysiological and morphological traits promoting nutrient acquisition and conservation, and morphological traits related to flammability, fire resistance, and recovery. The dominant photoautotrophs (trees) engineer habitats and underpin trophic webs. Resource gradients exert strong bottom-up controls
on trophic processes, but in some temperate forests, fires are significant top-down consumers of biomass, as well as influencing flammability feedbacks and timing of life-history processes, such as reproduction and recruitment.

# T2.1 Boreal and temperate montane forests and woodlands

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Evergreen, structurally simple forests and woodlands in cold climates are dominated by needle-
leaf conifers and may include a subdominant component of deciduous trees, especially in disturbed sites, accounting for
up to two-thirds of stand-level leaf biomass. Boreal forests are generally less diverse, more cold-tolerant and support a more migratory fauna than temperate montane forests. Structure varies from dense forest up to 30 m tall to stunted open woodlands &lt;5 m tall. Large trees engineer habitats of many fungi, non-vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrates that depend on rugose bark, coarse woody debris, or large tree canopies. Energy is mainly from autochthonous sources, but may include allochthonous subsidies from migratory vertebrates. Primary productivity is limited by seasonal cold and may also
be limited by water deficit on coarse textured soils. Forested bogs occupy peaty soils (TF1.6). Seasonal primary productivity may sustain a trophic web with high densities of small and large herbivores (e.g. hare, bear, deer and insects), with feline, canine and raptor predators. Browsers are top-down regulators of plant biomass and cyclers of nitrogen, carbon and nutrients. Forest structure may be disrupted by insect defoliation or fires on multi- decadal cycles. Tree recruitment occurs semi-continuously in gaps or episodically following canopy fires and may be limited
by spring frost, desiccation, permafrost fluctuations, herbivory and surface fires. Plants and animals have strongly seasonal growth and reproductive phenology, and possess morphological, behavioural and ecophysiological traits enabling cold-tolerance and the exploitation of short growing seasons. Plant traits include bud protection, extra-cellular freezing tolerance, hardened evergreen needle leaves with low SLA or deciduous leaves with high SLA, cold-stratification seed dormancy, seasonal geophytic growth forms and vegetative storage
organs. Tracheids in conifers confer resistance to cavitation in drought by compartmentalising water transport tissues. Some large herbivores and most birds migrate to winter habitats from the boreal zone, and thus function as mobile links, dispersing other biota and bringing allochthonous subsidies of energy
and nutrients into the system. Hibernation is common among sedentary vertebrates, while insect life cycles have adult phases cued to spring emergence.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These systems are driven by large seasonal temperature ranges, cold winters with prolonged winter snow, low light, short growing seasons (1–3 months averaging &gt;10°C) and severe post-thaw frosts. There is an overall water surplus, but annual precipitation can be &lt;200 mm. Soil moisture recharged by winter snow sustains the system through evapotranspiration peaks in summer, but moisture can be limiting where these systems extend to mountains in warm semi-arid latitudes. The acid soils usually accumulate peat and upper horizons may be frozen in winter. Forests may be prone to lightning-induced canopy fires on century time scales and surface fires on multi-decadal scales.
## DISTRIBUTION

Boreal distribution across Eurasia and North America, extending to temperate (rarely subtropical) latitudes on mountains.

# T2.2 Deciduous temperate forests

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These structurally simple, winter deciduous forests have high productivity and LAI in summer. Winter dormancy, hibernation and migration are common life histories among plants and animals enabling cold avoidance. Local endemism is comparatively low and there are modest levels of diversity across major taxa. The forest canopy comprises at least two-thirds deciduous broad-leaf foliage (notophylll-mesophyll) with high Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and up to one-third evergreen (typically needleleaf) cover. As well as deciduous woody forms, annual turnover of above-ground biomass also occurs some in non-woody geophytic and other ground flora, which are insulated from the cold beneath winter snow and flower soon after snowmelt before tree canopy closure. Annual leaf turnover is sustained by fertile substrates and water surplus, with nutrient withdrawal from foliage and storage of starch prior to fall. Tissues are protected from cold by supercooling rather than extra-cellular freeze-tolerance. Dormant buds are insulated from frost by bracts or by burial below the soil in some non-woody plants. Fungal and microbial decomposers play vital roles in cycling carbon and nutrients
in the soil surface horizon. Despite highly seasonal primary productivity, the trophic network includes large browsing herbivores (deer), smaller granivores and herbivores (rodents and hares) and mammalian predators (canids and felines). Most invertebrates are seasonally active. Behavioural and life-history traits allow animals to persist through cold winters, including through dense winter fur, food caching, winter foraging, hibernation, dormant life phases and migration. Migratory animals provide allochthonous subsidies of energy and nutrients and promote incidental dispersal of other biota. Browsing mammals and insects are major consumers of plant biomass and cyclers of nitrogen, carbon and nutrients. Deciduous trees may be early colonisers of disturbed areas (later replaced
by evergreens), but are also stable occupants across large temperate regions. Tree recruitment is limited by spring frost, allelopathy and herbivory, and occurs semi-continuously in gaps. Herbivores may influence densities of deciduous forest canopies by regulating tree regeneration. Deciduous leaf fall may exert allelopathic control over tree seedlings and seasonal ground flora.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Phenological processes in these forests are driven by large seasonal temperature ranges (mean winter temperatures &lt;-1°C, summer means up to 22°C), typically with substantial winter snow and limited growing season, with 4–6 months &gt;10°C, and severe post-thaw frosts. Fertile soils with high N levels and an overall water surplus support deciduous leaf turnover. Fires are uncommon.

## DISTRIBUTION

Cool temperate Europe (southwest Russia to British Isles), northeast Asia (northeast China, southern Siberia Korea, and Japan), and northeast America. Limited occurrences in warm-temperate zones of south Europe and Asia and the Midwest USA.)

# T2.3 Oceanic cool temperate rainforests

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Broadleaf and needleleaf rainforests in cool temperate climates have evergreen or semi-deciduous tree canopies with high LAI and mostly nanophyll-microphyll foliage. Productivity is moderate to high and constrained by strongly seasonal growth and reproductive phenology and moderate levels of frost tolerance. SLA may be high but lower than in T2.2. Evergreen trees typically dominate, but deciduous species become more abundant in sites prone to severe
frost and/or with high soil fertility and moisture surplus. The smaller range of leaf sizes and SLA, varied phenology, frost tolerance, broader edaphic association and wetter, cooler climate distinguish these forests from warm temperate forests (T2.4). Local or regional endemism is significant in many taxa. Nonetheless, energy sources are primarily autochthonous. Trophic networks are less complex than in other cool-temperate or boreal forests (T2.1 and T2.2), with weaker top-down regulation due to the lower diversity and abundance of large herbivores and predators. Tree diversity is low (usually &lt;8–10 spp./ha), with abundant epiphytic and terrestrial bryophytes, pteridophytes, lichens, a modest range of herbs, and conspicuous fungi, which are important decomposers. The vertebrate fauna is mostly sedentary and of low-moderate diversity. Most plants recruit in the shade and some remain
in seedling banks until gap-phase dynamics are driven by individual tree-fall, lightning strikes, or by extreme wind storms in some areas. Tree recruitment varies with tree masting events, which strongly influence trophic dynamics, especially of rodents and their predators.
## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

There is a large water surplus, rarely with summer deficits. Rainfall is seasonal, borne on westerly winds peaking in winter months and inter-annual variability is relatively low. Cool winters (minima typically &lt;0–5°C for three months) limit the duration of the growing season. Maritime air masses are the major supply of climatic moisture and moderate winters and summer temperatures. Light may
be limited in winter by frequent cloud cover and high latitude.
Intermittent winter snow does not persist for more than a few days or weeks. Soils are moderately fertile to infertile and may accumulate peat. Exposure to winter storms and landslides leaves imprints on forest structure in some regions. Fires are rare, occurring on century time scales when lightning (or human) ignitions follow extended droughts.

## DISTRIBUTION

Cool temperate coasts of Chile and Patagonia, New Zealand, Tasmania and the Pacific Northwest, rarely extending to warm-temperate latitudes on mountains in Chile, southeast Australia, and outliers above 2,500-m elevation in the Papua New Guinea highlands. Some authors extend
the concept to wet boreal forests on the coasts of northwest Europe, Japan and northeast Canada.

# T2.4 Warm temperate laurophyll forests

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Relatively productive but structurally simple closed-canopy forests with high LAI occur in humid warm-temperate to subtropical climates. The tree canopies
are more uniform than most tropical forests (T1.1 and T1.2)
and usually lack large emergents. Their foliage is often leathery and glossy (laurophyll) with intermediate SLA values, notophyll- microphyll sizes and prodigiously evergreen. Deciduous species are rarely scattered within the forest canopies. These features, and drier, warmer climates and often more acid soils, distinguish them from oceanic cool temperate forests (T2.3), while in
the subtropics they transition to T1 forests. Autochthonous energy supports relatively high primary productivity, weakly limited by summer drought and sometimes by acid substrates. Forest function is regulated mainly by bottom-up processes related to resource competition rather than top-down trophic processes or disturbance regimes. Trophic structure is simpler than in tropical forests, with moderate levels of diversity and endemism among major taxa (i.e. typically &lt;20 tree spp./ha), but local assemblages of birds, bats and canopy invertebrates may be abundant and species-rich, and play important roles
in pollination and seed dispersal. Canopy insects are the major consumers of primary production and a major food source for birds. Decomposers and detritivores, such as invertebrates, fungi and microbes on the forest floor, are critical to nutrient cycling. Vertebrate herbivores are relatively uncommon, with low-moderate mammalian diversity. Although epiphytes and lianas are present, plant life-form traits that are typical of tropical forests (T1.1 and T1.2), such as buttress roots, compound leaves, monopodial growth and cauliflory, are uncommon
or absent in warm-temperate rainforests. Some trees have ecophysiological tolerance of acid soils (i.e. through aluminium accumulation). Gap-phase dynamics are driven by individual tree-fall and lightning strikes, but many trees are shade-tolerant and recruit slowly in the absence of disturbance. Ground vegetation includes varied growth forms but few grasses.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The environmental niche of these forests is defined by a modest overall water surplus with no distinct dry season, albeit moderate summer water deficits in some years. Mean annual rainfall is typically 1,200–2,500 mm, but topographic mesoclimates (e.g. sheltered gullies and orographic processes) sustain reliable moisture at some sites. Temperatures are mild with moderate seasonality and a growing season of 6–8 months, and mild frosts occur. Substrates may be acidic with high levels of Al and Fe that limit the uptake
of nutrients. These forests may be embedded in fire-prone landscapes but are typically not flammable due to their moist microclimates .

## DISTRIBUTION

Patchy warm temperate-subtropical distribution at 26–43° latitude, north or south of the Equator.

# T2.5 Temperate pyric humid forests

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

This group includes the tallest forests on earth. They are moist, multi-layered forests in wet-temperate climates with complex spatial structure and very high biomass and LAI. The upper layer is an open canopy of sclerophyllous trees 40–90 m tall with long, usually unbranched trunks. The open canopy structure allows light transmission sufficient for
the development of up to three subcanopy layers, consisting mostly of non-sclerophyllous trees and shrubs with higher
SLA than the upper canopy species. These forests are highly productive, grow rapidly, draw energy from autochthonous sources and store very large quantities of carbon, both above and below ground. They have complex trophic networks with
a diverse invertebrate, reptile, bird and mammal fauna with assemblages that live primarily in the tree canopy or the forest floor, and some that move regularly between vertical strata. Some species are endemic and have traits associated with
large trees, including the use of wood cavities, thick or loose bark, large canopies, woody debris, and deep, moist leaf litter. There is significant diversification of avian foraging methods and hence a high functional and taxonomic diversity of birds. High deposition rates of leaf litter and woody debris sustain diverse fungal decomposers and invertebrate detritivores and provide nesting substrates and refuges for ground mammals and avian insectivores. The shade-tolerant ground flora may include a diversity of ferns forbs, grasses (mostly C3) and bryophytes.
The dominant trees are shade-intolerant and depend on tree- fall gaps or periodic fires for regeneration. In cooler climates, trees are killed by canopy fires but may survive surface fires,
and canopy seedbanks are crucial to persistence. Epicormic resprouting (i.e. from aerial stems) is more common in warmer climates. Subcanopy and ground layers include both shade- tolerant and shade-intolerant plants, the latter with physically and physiologically dormant seedbanks that cue episodes of mass regeneration to fire. Multi-decadal or century-scale canopy fires consume biomass, liberate resources and trigger life-history processes in a range of biota. Seedbanks sustain plant diversity through storage effects.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

There is an annual water surplus with seasonal variation (peak surplus in winter) and rare major summer deficits associated with inter-annual drought cycles. Multiple tree layers produce a light diminution gradient and moist micro-climates at ground level. Winters are cool and summers are warm with occasional heatwaves that dry out
the moist micro-climate and enable periodic fires, which may
be extremely intense and consume the canopy. The growing season is 6–8 months; snow is uncommon and short-lived. Soils are relatively fertile, but often limited in Nitrogen.

## DISTRIBUTION

Subtropical - temperate southeast and temperate southwest Australia.

# T2.6 Temperate pyric sclerophyll forests and woodlands

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Forests and woodlands, typically 10–30 m tall with an open evergreen sclerophyllous tree
canopy and low-moderate LAI grow in fire-prone temperate landscapes. Productivity is lower than other temperate and tropical forest systems, limited by low nutrient availability and summer water deficits. Abundant light and water (except in peak summer) enable the development of substantial biomass with high C:N ratios. Trees have microphyll foliage with low to very low SLA. Sclerophyll or subsclerophyll shrubs with low to very low SLA foliage form a prominent layer between the trees. A sparse ground layer of C3 and C4 tussock grasses and forbs becomes more prominent on soils of loamy texture. Diversity and local endemism may be high among some taxa including plants, birds, and some invertebrates such as dipterans and hemipterans. Low nutrients and summer droughts limit the diversity and abundance of higher trophic levels. Plant traits (e.g. sclerophylly, stomatal invagination, tubers and seedbanks) confer tolerance to pronounced but variable summer water deficits. Plants possess traits that promote the efficient capture and retention of nutrients, including specialised root structures, N-fixing bacterial associations, slow leaf turnover and high allocation of photosynthates to structural tissues and exudates. Consumers have traits that enable the consumption of high-fibre biomass. Mammalian herbivores (i.e. the folivorous koala) can exploit high-fibre content and phenolics. Plants and animals have morphological and behavioural traits that allow tolerance or avoidance of fire and the life-history processes of many taxa are cued to fire (especially plant recruitment). Key fire traits in plants include recovery organs protected by thick bark or burial, serotinous seedbanks (i.e. held in plant canopies), physical
and physiological seed dormancy and pyrogenic reproduction. Almost all plants are shade-intolerant and fire is a critical top- down regulator of diversity through storage effects and the periodic disruption of plant competition.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Hot summers generate a marked but variable summer water deficit, usually with a modest winter surplus, irrespective of whether rainfall is highly seasonal with winter maximum, aseasonal, or weakly seasonal with inter- annually variable summer maxima. Soils are acidic, sandy, or loamy in texture, and low to very impoverished in P and N. Hot summers define a marked season for canopy or surface fires at decadal to multi-decadal intervals. Light frost occurs periodically in some areas but snow is rare.

## DISTRIBUTION

Temperate regions of Australia, the Mediterranean, and central California.
