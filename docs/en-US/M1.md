The Marine shelf biome is distributed globally between the shoreline and deep sea-floor biomes and is dominated by benthic productivity. It includes ecosystems with biogenic substrates (such as seagrass meadows, kelp forests, oyster beds and coral reefs) and minerogenic substrates, including rocky reefs, sandy bottoms and muddy bottoms. The availability of light and nutrients are key structuring factors, influencing productivity and ecosystem structure and function. Turbidity and depth gradients influence light availability. Productivity depends on upwelling currents that deliver nutrients from the deep ocean floor, as well as the strength of nutrient inputs from the land, delivered largely by fluvial systems. Light is influenced by depth gradients, but also by water clarity (cf. turbidity), and determines whether macrophytes and animals dependent on photosynthetic symbionts are able to establish and persist. Additionally,
whether the bottom type is hard or soft dictates whether sessile organisms can dominate, forming biogenic habitats
that protrude into the water column. A shallow water biome,
the marine shelf is shaped by kinetic wave energy and, in polar regions, also ice scour. Positive feedback loops, whereby the habitat structures formed by sessile organisms dampens kinetic energy, can enable ecotypes to persist under marginally suitable conditions. The strength of top-down control by consumers
can be an important factor in determining community structure. Depending on the benthic biota, energy sources can vary from net autotrophic to net heterotrophic. Temperature and, to a lesser extent, salinity influence the presence and identity of dominant habitat-forming biota. Currents can influence ecotypes by determining patterns of larval dispersal and the flow of resources.

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Seagrass meadows are important sources of organic matter, much of which is retained by seagrass sediments. Seagrasses are the only subtidal marine flowering plants and underpin the high productivity
of these systems. Macroalgae and epiphytic algae also contribute to productivity, supporting both detritus production and autochthonous trophic structures, but compete with seagrasses for light. The complex three-dimensional structure of the seagrass provides shelter and cover to juvenile fish and invertebrates, binds sediments and, at fine scales, dissipates waves and currents. Seagrass ecosystems support infauna living amongst their roots, epifauna, and epiflora living on their shoots and leaves, as well as nekton in the water column.
They have a higher abundance and diversity of flora and fauna, compared to surrounding unvegetated soft sediments and comparable species richness and abundances to most other marine biogenic habitats. Mutualisms with lucinid molluscs
may influence seagrass persistence. Mesograzers, such as amphipods and gastropods, play an important role in controlling epiphytic algal growth on seagrass. Grazing megafauna, such as dugongs, manatees and turtles, can contribute to patchy seagrass distributions, although they tend to ‘garden’ rather than deplete seagrass.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Typically found in the subtidal zone on soft sedimentary substrates but also occasionally on rocky substrates on low- to moderate-energy coastlines with low turbidity and on intertidal shorelines. Minimum water depth is determined mainly by wave orbital velocity, tidal exposure and wave energy (i.e. waves disturb seagrass and mobilise sediment), while maximum depth is limited by the vertical diminution of light intensity in the water column. Seagrass growth can be limited by nitrogen and phosphorous availability, but in eutrophic waters, high nutrient availability can lead to the overgrowth of seagrasses by epiphytes and shading by algal blooms, leading to ecosystem collapse. Large storm events and associated wave action lead to seagrass loss.

## DISTRIBUTION

Widely distributed along the temperate and tropical coastlines of the world.

# M1.2 Kelp forests

BIOME: M1 MARINE SHELFS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Kelps are benthic brown macroalgae (Order Laminariales) forming canopies that shape the structure and function of these highly productive, diverse ecosystems. These large (up to 30 m in length), fast-growing (up to 0.5 m/ day) autotrophs produce abundant consumable biomass, provide vertical habitat structure, promote niche diversity, alter light-depth gradients, dampen water turbulence and moderate water temperatures. Traits, such as large, flexible photosynthetic organs, rapid growth and strong benthic holdfasts enable
kelps to persist on hard substrates in periodically turbulent waters. These kelps may occur as scattered individuals in other ecosystem types, but other macroalgae (e.g. green and coralline) rarely form canopies with similar function and typically form mixed communities with sessile invertebrates (see M1.5 and M1.6). Some kelps are fully submerged, while others form dense canopies on the water surface, which profoundly affect light, turbulence and temperature in the water column. Interactions among co-occurring kelps are generally positive or neutral, but competition for space and light is an important evolutionary driver. Kelp canopies host a diverse epiflora and epifauna,
with some limpets having unique kelp hosts. Assemblages of benthic invertebrate herbivores and detritivores inhabit the forest floor, notably echinoderms and crustaceans. The structure and diversity of life in kelp canopies provide forage for seabirds and mammals, such as gulls and sea otters, while small fish find refuge from predators among the kelp fronds. Herbivores keep epiphytes in check, but kelp sensitivity to herbivores makes
the forests prone to complex trophic cascades when declines
in top predators release herbivore populations from top-down regulation. This may drastically reduce the abundance of kelps and dependent biota, and lead to replacement of the forests by urchin barrens, which persist as an alternative stable state.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Kelp forests are limited by light, nutrients, salinity, temperature and herbivory. Growth rates are limited by light and proximity to sediment sources. High nutrient requirements are met by terrestrial runoff or upwelling currents, although eutrophication can lead to transition to turf beds. Truncated thermal niches limit the occurrence of kelps
in warm waters. Herbivory on holdfasts influences recruitment and can constrain reversals of trophic cascades, even when propagules are abundant. Kelp forests occur on hard substrates in the upper photic zone and rely on wave action and currents for oxygen. Currents also play important roles in dispersing
the propagules of kelps and associated organisms. Storms
may dislodge kelps, creating gaps that may be maintained by herbivores or rapidly recolonized.

## DISTRIBUTION

Nearshore rocky reefs to depths of 30 m in temperate and polar waters. Absent from warm tropical waters but present in upwelling zones off Oman, Namibia, Cape Verde, Peru and the Galapagos.

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Coral reefs are biogenic structures that have been built up and continue to grow over decadal timescales as a result of the accumulation of calcium carbonate laid down by hermatypic (scleractinian) corals and other organisms. Reef-building corals are mixotrophic colonies of coral polyps in endosymbiotic relationships with photosynthesizing zooxanthellae that assimilate solar energy and nutrients, providing almost all of the metabolic requirements for their host. The corals develop skeletons by extracting dissolved carbonate from seawater and depositing it as aragonite crystals. Corals reproduce asexually, enabling the growth of colonial structures. They also reproduce sexually, with mostly synchronous spawning related to annual lunar cues. Other sessile organisms, including sponges, soft corals, gorgonians, coralline algae and other algae, add to the diversity and structural complexity of coral reef ecosystems. The complex three-dimensional structure provides a high diversity of habitat niches and resources that support a highly diverse and locally endemic marine biota, including crustaceans, polychaetes, holothurians, echinoderms and other groups, with one-quarter of marine life estimated
to depend on reefs for food and/or shelter. Diversity is high
at all taxonomic levels relative to all other ecosystems. The trophic network is highly complex, with functional diversity represented on the benthos and in the water column by primary producers, herbivores, detritivores, suspension-feeders, and multiple interacting levels of predators. Coral diseases also
play a role in reef dynamics. The vertebrate biota includes fish, snakes, turtles and mammals. The fish fauna is highly diverse, with herbivores and piscivores displaying a wide diversity of generalist and specialist diets (including parrot fish that consume corals), feeding strategies, schooling and solitary behaviours and reproductive strategies. The largest vertebrates include marine turtles and sharks.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Coral reefs are limited to warm, shallow (rarely &gt;60 m deep), clear, relatively nutrient- poor, open coastal waters, where salinity is 3.0–3.8% and
sea temperatures vary (17–34°C). Cooler temperatures are insufficient to support coral growth, while warmer temperatures cause coral symbiosis to break down (i.e. bleaching). Reef geomorphology varies from atolls, barrier reefs, fringing reefs and lagoons to patch reefs depending upon hydrological and geological conditions. Reef structure and composition vary with depth gradients, such as light intensity and turbulence, and exposure gradients, such as exposure itself and sedimentation. Storm regimes and marine heat waves (thermal anomalies) drive cycles of reef destruction and renewal.

## DISTRIBUTION

Tropical and subtropical waters on continental and island shelves, mostly within latitudes of 30°N and 30°S.

# M1.4 Shellfish beds and reefs

BIOME: M1 MARINE SHELFS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These ecosystems are founded
on intertidal or subtidal three-dimensional biogenic structures formed primarily by high densities of oysters and/or mussels, which provide habitat for a moderate diversity of algae, invertebrates and fishes, few of which are entirely restricted to oyster reefs. Structural profiles may be high (i.e. reefs) or low
(i.e. beds). Shellfish reefs are usually situated on sedimentary
or rocky substrates, but pen shells form high-density beds of vertically orientated non-gregarious animals in soft sediments. Sessile filter-feeders dominate these strongly heterotrophic but relatively high-productivity systems. Tides bring in food and carry away waste. Energy and matter in waste is processed
by a subsystem of deposit-feeding invertebrates. Predators
are a small component of the ecosystem biomass, but are nevertheless important in influencing the recruitment, biomass and diversity of prey organisms (i.e. seastar predation on mussels). Shellfish beds and reefs may influence adjoining estuaries and coastal waters physically and biologically. Physically, they modify patterns of currents, dampen wave energy and remove suspended particulate matter through filter- feeding. Biologically, they remove phytoplankton and produce abundant oyster biomass. They function in biogeochemical cycling as carbon sinks, by increasing denitrification rates, and through N burial/sequestration. Relatively (or entirely) immobile and thin-shelled juveniles are highly susceptible to benthic predators, such as crabs, fish and birds. Recruitment can depend on protective microhabitats provided either by abiogenic or biogenic structures. In intertidal environments, the survival
of shellfish can increase with density due to self-shading and moisture retention.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The availability of hard substrate, including shells of live or dead conspecifics, can limit the establishment of reef-forming shellfish, though a few occur on soft substrates. Many shellfish are robust to changes in salinity, closing their valves for days to weeks to avoid adverse conditions, but salinity may indirectly influence survival by determining susceptibility to parasites. High suspended sediment loads caused by high energy tides, rainfall and runoff events, or the erosion of coastal catchments can smother larvae and impede filter-feeding. Most reef- or bed-building shellfish cannot survive prolonged periods of low dissolved oxygen.
They are also sensitive to climate change stressors, such as temperature (and associated increased risk of desiccation for intertidal species), as well as lowered pH as they are calcifiers. In subtidal environments, the formation of reefs can help elevate animals above anoxic bottom waters.

## DISTRIBUTION

Estuarine and coastal waters of temperate and tropical regions, extending from subtidal to intertidal zones. Present-day distributions are shaped by historic overharvest, which has removed 85% of reefs globally.

# M1.5 Photo-limited marine animal forests

BIOME: M1 MARINE SHELFS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These benthic systems are characterised by high densities of megabenthic, sessile heterotrophic suspension feeders that act as habitat engineers and dominate a subordinate autotrophic biota. Unlike coral reefs and shellfish beds (also animal forests), the major
sessile animals include sponges, aphotic corals, hydroids, ascidians, hydrocorals, bryozoans, polychaetes and bivalves (the latter only dominate in M1.4). These engineer complex three-dimensional biogenic structures, sometimes of a
single species or distinct phylogenetic groups. The structural complexity generates environmental heterogeneity and
habitat, promoting a high diversity of invertebrate epifauna,
with microphytobenthos and fish. Endemism may be high.
Low light limits primary productivity especially by macroalgae, although microphytobenthos can be important. Energy flow
and depth-related processes distinguish these systems from their deepwater aphotic counterparts (M3.7). Overall, however, these systems are strongly heterotrophic, relying on benthic- pelagic coupling processes. Consequently, these systems are generally of moderate productivity and are often found near shallower, less photo-limited, high-productivity areas. Complex biogeochemical cycles govern nutrient release, particle retention and carbon fixation. Biodiversity is enhanced by secondary consumers (i.e. deposit-feeding and filter-feeding invertebrates). Predators may influence the biomass and diversity of epifaunal prey organisms. Recruitment processes in benthic animals can be episodic and highly localised and, together with slow growth rates, limit recovery from disturbance.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Light is generally
insufficient to support abundant macroalgae but is above the photosynthetic threshold for coralline algae and cyanobacteria. Light is limited by diffusion through deepwater, surface ice cover, turbidity from river outflow, or tannins in terrestrial runoff. Low to moderate temperatures may further limit productivity. These systems are generally found on hard substrates but can occur on soft substrates. Currents or resuspension and lateral transport processes are important drivers of benthic-pelagic coupling, hence food and nutrient supply. Natural physical disturbances are generally of low severity and frequency, but ice scour can generate successional mosaics where animal forests occur on subpolar shelves.

## DISTRIBUTION

Tropical to polar coastal waters extending from the shallow subtidal to the ‘twilight’ zone on the shelf. Present-day distributions are likely to have been modified by benthic trawling.

# M1.6 Subtidal rocky reefs

BIOME: M1 MARINE SHELFS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Submerged rocky reefs host trophically complex communities lacking a dense macroalgal canopy (cf. M1.2). Sessile primary producers and invertebrate filter-feeders assimilate autochthonous and allochthonous energy, respectively. Mobile biota occur in the water column. Reef-associated organisms have diverse dispersal modes. Some disperse widely as adults, some have non-dispersing larvae, others with sessile adult phases develop directly on substrates, or have larval stages or spores dispersed widely
by currents or turbulence. Sessile plants include green, brown and red algae. To reduce dislodgement in storms, macroalgae have holdfasts, while smaller species have low-growing ‘turf’
life forms. Many have traits, such as air lacunae or bladders
that promote buoyancy. Canopy algae are sparse at the depths or levels of wave exposure occupied by this functional group
(cf. kelp forests in M1.2). Algal productivity and abundance decline with depth due to diminution of light and are also kept
in check by periodic storms and a diversity of herbivorous fish, molluscs and echinoderms. The latter two groups and some
fish are benthic and consume algae primarily in turf form or at
its juvenile stage before stipes develop. Sessile invertebrates occur throughout. Some are high-turbulence specialists (e.g. barnacles, ascidians and anemones), while others become dominant at greater depths as the abundance of faster-growing algae diminishes (e.g. sponges and red algae). Fish include both herbivores and predators. Some are specialist bottom-dwellers, while others are more generalist pelagic species. Herbivores promote diversity through top-down regulation, influencing patch dynamics, trophic cascades and regime shifts involving kelp forests in temperate waters (M1.2). Mosaics of algal dominance, sessile invertebrate dominance and barrens may shift over time. Topographic variation in the rocky substrate promotes habitat diversity and spatial heterogeneity. This provides refuges from predators but also hiding places for ambush predators including crustaceans and fish.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Minerogenic rocky substrates with variable topography and cobbles are foundational to the habitats of many plants and animals, influencing how they capture resources and avoid predation. A strong depth gradient and substrate structures (e.g. overhangs and caves) limit light availability, as does turbidity. Currents and river outflows are crucial to the delivery of resources, especially nutrients, and also play a key role in biotic dispersal. Animal waste is a key nutrient source sustaining algal productivity in more nutrient-limited systems. Salinity is relatively constant through time (3.5% on average). Turbulence from subsurface wave action promotes substrate instability and maintains high levels of dissolved oxygen. Episodic storms generating more extreme turbulence shift sand and dislodge larger sessile organisms, create gaps that may be maintained by herbivores or rapidly recolonized.

## DISTRIBUTION

Widespread globally on rocky parts of continental and island shelves.

# M1.7 Subtidal sand beds

BIOME: M1 MARINE SHELFS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Medium to coarse-grained, unvegetated and soft minerogenic sediments show moderate levels of biological diversity. The trophic network is dominated by consumers with very few in situ primary producers. Interstitial microalgae and planktonic algae are present, but larger benthic primary producers are limited either by substrate instability or light, which diminishes with depth. In shallow waters, where light is abundant and soft substrates are relatively stable,
this group of systems is replaced by group M1.1, which is dominated by vascular marine plants. In contrast to those autochthonous systems, subtidal sand beds rely primarily on allochthonous energy, with currents generating strong bottom flows and a horizontal flux of food. Sandy substrates tend to have less organic matter content and lower microbial diversity and abundance than muddy substrates (M1.8). Soft sediments may be dominated by invertebrate detritivores and suspension- feeders, including burrowing polychaetes, crustaceans, echinoderms and molluscs. Suspension-feeders tend to be most abundant in high-energy environments where waves and currents move sandy sediments, detritus, and living organisms. The homogeneity and low structural complexity of the substrate exposes potential prey to predation, especially from pelagic fish. Large bioturbators, such as dugongs, stingrays and whales, may also be important predators. Consequently, many benthic animals possess specialised traits that enable other means of predator avoidance, such as burrowing, shells or camouflage.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The substrate is soft, minerogenic, low in organic matter, relatively homogeneous, structurally simple and mobile. The pelagic waters are moderate to high-energy environments, with waves and currents promoting substrate instability. Nonetheless, depositional processes dominate over erosion, leading to net sediment accumulation. Fluvial inputs from land and the erosion of headlands and sea cliffs contribute sediment, nutrients and organic matter, although significant lateral movement is usually driven by longshore currents. Light availability diminishes with depth. Mixing is promoted by waves and currents, ensuring low temporal variability in salinity, which averages 3.5%.

## DISTRIBUTION

Globally widespread around continental and island shelves.

# M1.8 Subtidal mud plains

BIOME: M1 MARINE SHELFS 
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

The muddy substrates of continental and island shelves support moderately productive ecosystems based on net allochthonous energy sources. In situ primary production is contributed primarily by microphytobenthos, mainly benthic diatoms with green microalgae, as macrophytes are scarce or absent. Both decline with depth as light diminishes. Drift algae can be extensive over muddy sediments, particularly in sheltered waters. Abundant heterotrophic microbes process detritus. The microbial community mediates most of the biogeochemical cycles in muddy sediments, with features distinguishing these ecosystems from subtidal sand beds (M1.7). Deposit feeders (notably burrowing polychaetes, crustaceans, echinoderms and molluscs) are important components of the trophic network, as the low kinetic energy environment promotes vertical food fluxes, which they are
able to exploit more effectively than suspension-feeders. The latter are less abundant on subtidal mud plains than on rocky reefs (M1.6) and Subtidal sand beds (M1.7), where waters
are more turbulent and generate stronger lateral food fluxes. Deposit feeders may also constrain the abundance of co- occurring suspension-feeders by disturbing benthic sediment that resettles and smothers their larvae and clogs their filtering structures. Nonetheless, suspension-feeding tube worms may be common over muddy sediments when settlement substrates are available. Although such interference mechanisms may be important, competition is generally weak. In contrast, foraging predators, including demersal fish, may have a major structuring influence on these systems through impacts on the abundance of infauna, particularly on settling larvae and recently settled juveniles, but also adults. Burrowing is a key mechanism of predator avoidance, and the associated bioturbation is influential on microhabitat diversity and resource availability within the sediment.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These depositional systems are characterised by low kinetic energy (weak turbulence and currents), which promotes the accumulation of fine-textured, stable sediments that are best developed on flat bottoms or gentle slopes. The benthic surface is relatively homogeneous, except where structure is engineered by burrowing organisms. The small particle size and poor interchange of interstitial water limit oxygen supply, and anaerobic conditions are especially promoted where abundant in-fall of organic matter supports higher bacterial activity that depletes dissolved oxygen. On
the other hand, the stability of muddy substrates makes them more conducive to the establishment of permanent burrows. Bioturbation and bio-irrigation activities by a variety of benthic fauna in muddy substrates are important contributors to marine nutrient and biogeochemical cycling as well as the replenishment of oxygen.

## DISTRIBUTION

Globally distributed in the low-energy waters of continental and island shelves.

# M1.9 Upwelling zones

REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Upwelled, nutrient-rich water supports very high net autochthonous primary production, usually through diatom blooms. These in turn support high biomass of copepods, euphausiids (i.e. krill), pelagic and demersal fish, marine mammals and birds. Fish biomass tends to be dominated by low- to mid-trophic level species, such
as sardine, anchovy and herring. The abundance of these
small pelagic fish has been hypothesised to drive ecosystem dynamics through ‘wasp-waist’ trophic control. Small pelagic fish exert top-down control on the copepod and euphausiid plankton groups they feed on and exert bottom-up control on predatory fish, although diel-migrant mesopelagic fish (M2.2) may have important regulatory roles. Abundant species of higher trophic levels include hake and horse mackerel, as well as pinnipeds and seabirds. Highly variable reproductive success of planktivorous fish reflects the fitness of spawners and suitable conditions for concentrating and retaining eggs and larvae inshore prior to maturity.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Upwelling is a wind-driven process that draws cold, nutrient-rich water towards the surface, displacing warmer, nutrient-depleted waters. The strength of upwelling depends on interactions between local current systems and the Coriolis effect that causes divergence, generally on the eastern boundaries of oceans. The rate of upwelling, the offshore transportation of nutrients and the degree of stratification in the water column once upwelling has occurred all determine the availability of nutrients to plankton, and hence the size and structure of the community that develops after an event. The main upwelling systems around the world extend to depths of up to 500 m at the shelf break, although primary production is restricted to the epipelagic zone (&lt;200 m). Upwelling zones are characterised by low sea-surface temperatures and high chlorophyll a concentrations, high variability due to large-scale interannual climate cycles (e.g El Niño Southern Oscillation), as well as the pulsed and seasonal nature of the driving winds, and periodic low-oxygen, low pH events due to high biological activity and die-offs.

## DISTRIBUTION

The most productive upwelling zones are coastal, notably in four major eastern-boundary current systems (the Canary, Benguela, California and Humboldt). Weaker upwelling processes occurring in the open ocean are included in M2.1 (i.e. along the intertropical convergence zone).
