# F1 Rivers and streams biome

Rivers and streams include lotic (running water) ecosystems, flowing from elevated uplands or underground springs to deltas, estuaries, and lakes. They are defined primarily by their linear structure, unidirectional flow regimes, and close interaction with the surrounding landscape. Individual rivers drain catchments separated by watersheds. Channels that make up a river system can be classified into stream orders, with 1st order streams having no tributaries, 2nd order streams having 1st order tributaries, 3rd order having 2nd order tributaries and so on. The world’s largest rivers are 10th-12th order. Flow regimes depend on stream order and rainfall patterns in the catchment (except in regulated rivers and spring-fed streams), which vary from year-round to seasonal to episodic. Stream gradients determine flow velocity and turbulence, bank and substrate structure,
and habitat variability, but flow variability depends on regional climate and local weather. River systems in arid zones may remain dry for several years. These factors act as selection filters, differentiating lotic ecosystems and their species’ traits amongst flow regimes, and between uplands and lowlands. Productivity tends to increase from uplands to lowlands and is driven both by allochthonous energy sources that contribute coarse organic matter from terrestrial ecosystems in adjacent riparian zones and upper catchments, and by autochthonous energy synthesis by biofilms or phytoplankton. Phytoplankton is important downstream in larger, slower rivers that carry smaller organic particles and more dissolved organic matter. Erosion and depositional processes depend on the gradient
and position of a stream reach within a catchment, and are fundamental to downstream passage of nutrients and organic matter and exchange between river ecosystems and surrounding land. Anthropogenic nutrient inputs increase downstream and vary with land use. Rivers with extensive peatlands in their catchments are rich in tannins, which reduce light penetration through the water column, increase acidity, promote microbial activity that thrives on dissolved organic carbon, and thereby reduce oxygen levels, productivity and biotic diversity, although endemism may be high. Streams in cold climates freeze over in winter, imposing seasonal constraints on productivity and the movement of organisms. Much of the biotic diversity resides in or on the stream benthos. Trophic webs are more complex in large rivers due to greater resource availability and niche diversity, and species-catchment area relationships. Invertebrate detritivores consume fragments of organic matter, providing resources for predatory macroinvertebrates and fish, which in turn support larger predatory fish, waterbirds, reptiles, and some mammals. Specialised species-level traits are associated with different flow regimes and life history strategies often align with patterns of resource availability. For example, suspension feeding is common in high flow velocities, cold tolerance and seasonal dormancy occur in freeze-thaw streams, life cycles are geared to autumnal leaf fall in temperate forested catchments, and desiccation tolerance and dormant life stages dominate in episodic rivers.

BIOME: F1 RIVERS AND STREAMS 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These 1st-3rd order streams generally have steep gradients, fast flows, coarse substrates, often with a riffle-pool (shallow and fast vs deeper and slow) sequence of habitats, and periodic (usually seasonal) high-flow events. Many organisms have specialised morphological and behavioural adaptations to high flow-velocity environments. Riparian trees produce copious leaf fall that provide allochthonous subsidies and support somewhat separate foodwebs to those based
on in situ primary production by bryophytes and biofilms. Tree shade conversely light-limits productivity, a trade-off that relaxes seasonally where deciduous trees dominate. Microbes and detritivores (i.e. invertebrate shredders) break down leaf fall
and other organic matter. Microbial biofilms comprising algae, fungi and bacteria establish on rocks and process dissolved organic matter. Invertebrates include shredders (consuming coarse particles), grazers (consuming biofilm), collectors and filter feeders (consuming benthic and suspended fine particles, respectively) and predators. Many benthic macroinvertebrates, mostly insects, have aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults. Filter feeders have traits adapted to swift flows, allowing them to hold fast to substrates while capturing resources, while benthic bryophytes provide shelter for other organisms. Fish are typically small predators of aquatic invertebrates and insects on the water surface. Birds typically have specialised foraging behaviours (e.g. dippers and kingfishers). Trophic cascades involving rapid algal growth, invertebrate grazers and fish are common.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Upland streams have flash flow regimes with high velocity and relatively low, but variable perennial volume. Turbulence sustains highly oxygenation. Groundwater-delivered subsidies support streamflow, with up to 50% of summer flow and 100% of winter flow originating as groundwater. This modulates stream temperatures, keeping temperatures lower in summer and higher in winter; and deliver nutrients, especially if there are N-fixing plants along the groundwater flow path. They flow down moderate to steep slopes causing considerable erosion and sediment transport. These factors drive nutrient and organic matter transport downstream. Flow volume and variability, including periodic flood regimes, depend on rainfall seasonality, snowmelt from cold-climate catchments, as well as catchment size. Peat-rich catchments feed dark dystrophic waters to the streams.

## DISTRIBUTION

High proportion of global stream length. In steep to moderate terrain throughout the humid tropical and temperate zones, rarely extending to boreal latitudes.

# F1.2 Permanent lowland rivers

BIOME: F1 RIVERS AND STREAMS 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Small-medium lowland rivers (stream orders 4-9) are productive depositional ecosystems with trophic webs that are less diverse than large lowland rivers (F1.7). Macrophytes rooted in benthos or along the river margins contribute most primary production, but allochthonous inputs from floodplains and upper catchments generally dominate energy flow in the system. The biota tolerates a range of temperatures, which vary with catchment climate. Aquatic
biota have physiological, morphological and even behavioural adaptations to lower oxygen concentrations, which may vary seasonally and diurnally. Zooplankton can be abundant in slower deeper rivers. Sessile (i.e. mussels) and scavenging (i.e. crayfish) macroinvertebrates are associated with the hyporheic zone and structurally complex microhabitats in moderate flow environments, including fine sediment and woody debris. Fish communities are diverse and may contribute to complex trophic networks. They include large predatory fish (i.e. sturgeons), smaller predators of invertebrates, herbivores, and detritivores. The feeding activities and movement of piscivorous birds (i.e. cormorants), diadromous fish (seawater-freshwater migrants), mammals (i.e. otters), and reptiles (i.e. turtles) extend trophic network beyond instream waters. Riparian zones vary in complexity from forested banks to shallow areas where emergent, floating and submerged macrophyte vegetation grows. Intermittently connected oxbow lakes or billabongs increase the complexity of associated habitats, providing more lentic waters for a range of aquatic fauna and flora.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These rivers are distinguished by shallow gradients, low turbulence, low to moderate flow velocity and moderate flow volumes (&lt;10,000m3/s). Flows are continuous but may vary seasonally depending on catchment precipitation. This combination of features is most common at low altitudes below 200 m and rarely occurs above 1,500 m. River channels are tens to a few hundred metres wide and up
to tens of metres deep with mostly soft sediment substrates. They are dominated by depositional processes. Surface water and groundwater mix in the alluvium in the hyporheic zone, which plays an important role in nutrient cycling. Overbank
flows increase turbulence and turbidity. Locally or temporally important erosional processes redistribute sediment and produce geomorphically dynamic depositional features (e.g. braided channels and point bars). Nutrient levels depend on riparian/floodplain inputs and vary with catchment geochemistry. Oxygen and temperatures also vary with climate and catchment features. For catchments with extensive peatlands, waters
may be tannin-rich, poorly oxygenated, acidic and dark, thus reducing productivity and diversity.

## DISTRIBUTION

Distributed throughout tropical and temperate lowlands but very uncommon in arid zones. They are absent from boreal zones, where they are replaced by F1.3.

# F1.3 Freeze-thaw rivers and streams

BIOME: F1 RIVERS AND STREAMS 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

In seasonally cold montane and boreal environments, the surfaces of both small streams and large rivers freeze in winter. These systems have relatively simple trophic networks with low functional and taxonomic diversity,
but the biota may include local endemics. In small, shallow streams, substrate algae are the principal autotrophs, while phytoplankton occur in larger rivers and benthic macrophytes are rare. All are seasonally inactive or curtailed when temperatures are cold and surface ice reduces light penetration through the water. Bottom-up regulatory processes dominate, subsidies of dissolved organic carbon and nutrients from spring meltwaters and riparian vegetation along smaller streams are crucial to maintaining the detritivores that dominate the trophic network. Overall decomposition rates of coarse particles are low, but can exceed rates per degree day in warmer climates as the fauna are adapted to cold temperatures. Microbial decomposers often dominate small streams, but in larger rivers, the massive increase in fine organic particles in spring meltwaters can support abundant filter feeders which consume huge quantities of suspended particles and redeposit them within the river
bed. Resident invertebrates survive cold temperatures, through dormant life stages extended life cycles and physiological adaptations. Vertebrate habitat specialists (e.g. dippers, small fish, beavers and otters) tolerate low temperatures with traits, such as subcuticular fat, thick hydrophobic and/or aerated fur
or feathers. Many fish disperse from frozen habitat to deeper water refuges during the winter (i.e. deep pools) before foraging in the meltwater streams from spring to autumn. In the larger rivers, fish, and particularly migratory salmonids returning to their natal streams and rivers for breeding, Fish are a food source for itinerant terrestrial predators such as bears. When they die after reproduction, their decomposition in turn provides huge inputs of energy and nutrients to the system.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These rivers experience low winter temperatures and seasonal freeze-thaw regimes. Winter freezing is generally limited to the surface but can extend to the substrate forming ‘anchor ice’. Flows may continue below the
ice or may be intermittent in smaller streams or dry climates. Freezing reduces resource availability by reducing nutrient inputs, allochthonous organic matter and light penetration through the water. Light may also be attenuated at high latitudes and by high turbidity in erosional streams. Meltwaters drive increased flow and flooding in spring and summer. Carbon
and nutrient concentrations are greatest during spring floods, and pH tends to decrease with flow during spring and autumn. When catchments include extensive peatlands, waters may be tannin-rich, acidic and dark, thereby reducing light penetration and productivity.

## DISTRIBUTION

Restricted to boreal, subarctic, alpine and subalpine regions, with limited examples in the subantarctic and Antarctic.

# F1.4 Seasonal upland streams

BIOME: F1 RIVERS AND STREAMS 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Upland streams (orders 1-4)
with highly seasonal flows generally have low to moderate productivity and a simpler trophic structure than lowland rivers. They tend to be shallow, hence benthic algae are major contributors to in-stream food webs and productivity, but riparian zones and catchments both contribute allochthonous energy and organic carbon through leaf fall, which may include an annual deciduous component. Primary production also varies with light availability and flow. Taxonomic diversity varies between streams, but can be lower than permanent streams and relatively high in endemism. Traits that enable biota to persist in narrow and shallow channels with large seasonal variations in flow velocity, episodes of torrential flow, and seasonal desiccation include small body sizes (especially in resident fish), dormant life phases and/or burrowing (crustaceans), omnivorous diets and high dispersal ability, including seasonal migration. Compared to lowland rivers,
the trophic structure has a higher representation of algal and omnivorous feeders and low numbers of larger predators. Birds show specialist feeding strategies (i.e. dippers). Diversity and abundance of invertebrates and their predators (i.e. birds) fluctuate in response to seasonal flood regimes.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Flow and flood regimes in these rivers are highly variable between marked wet and dry seasons, with associated changes in water quality as solute concentration varies with volume. They may be perennial, with flows much-reduced in the dry season, or seasonally intermittent with flows ceasing and water persisting in isolated stagnant pools. Channels are narrow with steep to moderate gradients and seasonally high velocity and sometimes large volumes of water, producing overbank flows. This results in considerable turbulence, turbidity, and erosion during the wet season and coarse substrates (cobbles and boulders). Seasonal floods are critical to allochtonous subsidies and downstream exports of organic matter and nutrients.

## DISTRIBUTION

Elevated regions in seasonal tropical, subtropical and temperate climates worldwide.

# F1.5 Seasonal lowland rivers

BIOME: F1 RIVERS AND STREAMS 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These large riverine systems (stream orders 5–9) can be highly productive with trophic structures and processes shaped by seasonal hydrology and linkages to floodplain wetlands. In combination with biophysical heterogeneity, this temporal variability promotes functional diversity in the biota. Although trophic networks are complex due to the diversity of food sources and the extent of omnivory amongst consumers, food chains tend to be short and large mobile predator,s such as otters, large piscivorous waterbirds, sharks, dolphins and crocodilians (in the tropics), can have
a major impact on the food webs. Benthic algae are key contributors to primary productivity, although macrophytes become more important during the peak and late wet season when they also provide substrate for epiphytic algae. Rivers receive very significant resource subsidies from both algae and macrophytes on adjacent floodplains when they are connected by flows. Enhanced longitudinal hydrological connectivity during the wet season enables fish and other large aquatic consumers to function as mobile links, extending floodplain and estuarine resource subsidies upstream. Life cycle processess, including reproduction, recruitment and dispersal in most biota, are tightly cued to seasonally high flow periods, often with floodplain nursery areas for river fish, amphibians and larger invertebrates.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These rivers are driven
by cyclical, seasonal flow regimes. High-volume flows and floods occur during summer in the tropics or winter-spring at temperate latitudes, with two peaks in some areas. A decline of flows and reduced flood residence times during the transition
to the dry season is followed by low and disconnected flows during the dry season. Turbidity, light availability, erosion, sedimentation, lateral and longitudinal connectivity, biological activity, dissolved oxygen and solute concentrations all vary with this seasonal cycle. The inter-annual variability of this pattern depends on the catchment precipitation and sources of inflow that offset or mute the influences of rainfall seasonality (i.e. snow melt in South Asia). Streams may be single, multi-channelled or complex anabranching systems.

## DISTRIBUTION

Tropical, subtropical and temperate lowlands with seasonal inflow patterns worldwide.

# F1.6 Episodic arid rivers

BIOME: F1 RIVERS AND STREAMS 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Episodic rivers have high temporal variability in flows and resource availability, shaping a low-diversity biota with periodically high abundance of some organisms. Productivity is episodically high and punctuated by longer periods of low productivity (i.e. boom-bust dynamics). The trophic structure can be complex and dominated by autochthonous primary production. Even though riparian vegetation is sparse, allochthonous inputs from connected floodplains may be important. Top-down control of ecosystem structure is evident in some desert streams. Episodic rivers
are hotspots of biodiversity and ecological activity in arid landscapes, acting as both evolutionary and ecological
refuges. Most biota have ruderal life cycles, dormancy phases, or high mobility enabling them to tolerate or avoid long, dry periods and to exploit short pulses of high resource availability during flooding. During dry periods, many organisms survive
as dormant life phases (e.g. eggs or seeds), by reducing metabolism, or by persisting in perennial refugia (e.g. waterholes, shallow aquifers). They may rapidly recolonise the channel network during flow (networkers). Waterbirds survive dry phases by moving elsewhere, returning to breed during flows. The abundance of water, nutrients and food during flows and floods initiates rapid primary production (especially by algae), breeding and recruitment. Zooplankton are abundant in slower reaches during periods of flow. Macroinvertebrates, such as sessile filter-feeders (i.e. mussels) and scavengers (i.e. crayfish), may occur in moderate flow environments with complex microhabitats in fine sediment and amongst woody debris. Assemblages of fish and amphibians are dominated by small body sizes. Most fish species use inundated floodplains in larval, juvenile and mature life stages, and produce massive biomass after large floods. Organisms generally tolerate wide ranges of temperature, salinity and oxygen.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These mostly lowland systems are distinguished by highly episodic flows and flood regimes that vary with catchment size and precipitation. High-volume, short duration flows (days to weeks, rarely months) punctuate long dry periods fill channels and flood wetlands. Low elevational gradients and shallow channels result in low turbulence and low to moderate flow velocity. Lowland stream channels are broad, flat, and often anastomising, with mostly soft sandy sediments. Groundwater is usually within rooting zones of perennial plants, which may establish in channels after flow events. Sediment loads drive periodically high turbidity. Locally or temporally important erosional processes have roles in geomorphic dynamism redistributing sediment in depositional features (e.g. braided channels and point bars). Upland streams are prone to erosive flash floods. High nutrient levels are due to large catchments and riparian inputs but depend on catchment geochemistry. These rivers often flow over naturally saline soils. Salinity can thus be high and increases in drying phases.

## DISTRIBUTION

Arid and semi-arid mid-latitudes, in lowlands, and some uplands, but rarely above 1,500 m elevation.

# F1.7 Large lowland rivers

BIOME: F1 RIVERS AND STREAMS 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Large lowland rivers (typically stream orders 8–12) are highly productive environments with complex trophic webs which are supported by very large flow volumes. Primary production is mostly from autochthonous phytoplankton and riparian macrophytes, with allochthonous inputs from floodplains and upper catchments generally dominating energy flow in the system. The fauna includes a significant diversity of pelagic organisms. Zooplankton are abundant, while sessile
(i.e. mussels), burrowing (i.e. annelids) and scavenging (i.e. crustaceans) macroinvertebrates occur in the fine sediment
and amongst woody debris. Fish communities are diverse and contribute to complex trophic networks. They include large predatory fish (e.g. freshwater sawfish, piranha, alligator gar) and in some rivers endemic river dolphins, smaller predators
of invertebrates (benthic and pelagic feeders), phytoplankton herbivores, and detritivores. The feeding activities and movement of semi-aquatic piscivorous birds (i.e. cormorants), mammals (i.e. otters), and reptiles (e.g. turtles, crocodilians) connect the trophic network to other ecosystems beyond instream waters. Riparian and large floodplain zones vary in complexity from forested banks, to productive lentic oxbow lakes and extensive and complex flooded areas where emergent and floodplain vegetation grows (e.g. reeds and macrophytes, shrubs, trees). Riparian zones can be complex but have less direct influence on large rivers than smaller river ecosystems.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These rivers have shallow gradients with low turbulence, low to moderate flow velocity and very high flow volumes (&gt;10,000 m3/s), which are continuous but may vary seasonally depending on catchment area and precipitation (e.g. Congo River up to 41,000 m3/s, Amazon River up to 175,000 m3/s). River channels are wide (i.e. Amazon River: 11 km in dry season, up to 25 km when flooded at its widest point) and deep (e.g. Congo River up to 200 m; Mississippi River up to 60 m) with mostly soft sediment substrates. They are dominated by depositional processes so turbidity may
be high. Overbank flows increase turbulence and turbidity. Locally or temporally important erosional processes redistribute sediment and produce geomorphically dynamic depositional features (e.g. braided channels, islands and point bars). Nutrient levels are high due to large catchments and riparian/floodplain inputs but vary with catchment geochemistry. Moderate water temperatures are buffered due to large catchments.

## DISTRIBUTION

Tropical and subtropical lowlands, with a few extending to temperate zones. They are absent from arid regions, and in boreal zones are replaced by F1.3.
