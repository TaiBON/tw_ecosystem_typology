# F2 Lakes biome

The Lakes biome includes lentic ecosystems defined by their still waters. They vary in area, depth, water regime and connectivity to other aquatic systems across a global distribution. Gradients
in water regimes, temperature, lake size and salinity (and salt composition) exert critical influences on the function, productivity, diversity and trophic structure of lake ecosystems. Water regimes vary from permanent open waters to seasonal or episodic filling and drying on interannual time scales. Lakes span global climatic gradients, which influence their water regimes through catchment precipitation and evapotranspiration rates, as well as the seasonal freeze-thaw cycles of lake surfaces along latitudinal and altitudinal temperature gradients. The azonal character of the Lakes
biome, however, is due to the buffering of climatic influences by groundwater, geomorphology, and substrate. This is most evident in the water regimes of artesian springs, oases and geothermal wetlands, as their water sources are largely independent of climate. Lake and catchment substrates influence nutrient stocks and salinity, but concentrations may vary temporally depending on water regimes and mixing. Deeper and freeze-thaw lakes are often characterised by stratification, producing depth gradients
in nutrient and oxygen availability and temperatures. The deepest lakes extend to the aphotic zone. Productivity is determined by allochthonous inputs from the catchments and autochthonous inputs from phytoplankton, periphyton (i.e. biofilms), and submerged, floating and emergent macrophytes. Trophic webs tend to increase in size and complexity with lake size due to increased resource availability and niche diversity, but small shallow lakes have greater diversity than small deep lakes due to habitat heterogeneity and light penetration to the bottm allowing development of benthic macrophytes and associated biota. Salt lakes may have high productivity but simple trophic structures, with high abundances of few species. Invertebrate detritivores consume fragments of organic matter, providing resources for macroinvertebrates, fish, waterbirds, reptiles and mammals. Species traits appear to be strongly influenced by environmental filtering by the water regime (e.g. cold tolerance and seasonal dormancy occurs in freeze-thaw lakes and desiccation tolerance and dormant life stages dominate in ephemeral lakes) and water chemistry (i.e. tolerance to salinity in salt lakes).

# F2.1 Large permanent freshwater lakes

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Large permanent freshwater
lakes, generally exceeding 100 km2, are prominent landscape features connected to one or more rivers either terminally
or as flow-through systems. Shoreline complexity, depth, bathymetric stratification, and benthic topography promote niche diversity and zonation. High niche diversity and large volumes of permanent water (extensive, stable, connected habitat) support complex trophic webs with high diversity and abundance. High primary productivity may vary seasonally, driving succession, depending on climate, light availability,
and nutrient regimes. Autochthonous energy from abundant pelagic algae (mainly diatoms and cyanobacteria) and from benthic macrophytes and algal biofilms (in shallow areas)
is supplemented by allochthonous inflows that depend on catchment characteristics, climate, season, and hydrological connectivity. Zooplankton, invertebrate consumers, and herbivorous fish sustain high planktonic turnover and support upper trophic levels with abundant and diverse predatory fish, amphibians, reptiles, waterbirds, and mammals. This bottom- up web is coupled to a microbial loop, which returns dissolved organic matter to the web (rapidly in warm temperatures)
via heterotrophic bacteria. Obligate freshwater biota in large lakes, including aquatic macrophytes and macroinvertebrates (i.e. crustaceans) and fish, often display high catchment-level endemism, in part due to long histories of environmental variability in isolation. Marked niche differentiation in life history and behavioural feeding and reproductive traits enables sympatric speciation and characterises the most diverse assemblages of macroinvertebrates and fish (i.e. ~500 cichlid fish species in Lake Victoria). Large predators are critical in top-down regulation of lower trophic levels. Large lake volume buffers against nutrient-mediated change from oligotrophic to eutrophic states. Recruitment of many organisms is strongly influenced by physical processes such as large inflow events. Mobile birds and terrestrial mammals use the lakes as breeding sites and/or sources of drinking water and play key roles in the inter-catchment transfer of nutrients and organic matter and the dispersal of biota.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Large water volumes influence resource availability, environmental stability (through thermal buffering), and niche diversity. Water is from catchment inflows, which may vary seasonally with climate. Large lakes influence regional climate through evaporation, cooling,
and convection feedbacks. These processes also influence nutrient availability, along with catchment and lake substrates and vertical mixing. Mixing may be monomictic (i.e. annual)
or meromictic (i.e. seldom), especially in large tropical lakes, depending on inflow, depth, wind regimes, and seasonal temperature variation. Light varies with lake depth, turbidity, cloud cover, and latitude.

## DISTRIBUTION

Humid temperate and tropical regions on large land masses.

# F2.2 Small permanent freshwater lakes

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Small permanent freshwater lakes, pools or ponds are lentic environments with relatively high perimeter-to-surface area and surface-area-to-volume ratios. Most are &lt;1 km2 in area, but this functional group includes lakes of transitional sizes up to 100 km2, while the largest lakes (&gt;100 km2) are classified in F2.1. Niche diversity increases
with lake size. Although less diverse than larger lakes, these lakes may support phytoplankton, zooplankton, shallow-
water macrophytes, invertebrates, sedentary and migratory
fish, reptiles, waterbirds, and mammals. Primary productivity, dominated by cyanobacteria, algae, and macrophytes, arises from allochthonous and autochthonous energy sources,
which vary with lake and catchment features, climate, and hydrological connectivity. Productivity can be highly seasonal, depending on climate, light, and nutrients. Permanent water
and connectivity are critical to obligate freshwater biota, such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes. Trophic structure and complexity depend on lake size, depth, location, and connectivity. Littoral zones and benthic pathways are integral to overall production and trophic interactions. Shallow lakes tend to be more productive (by volume and area) than deep lakes because light penetrates to the bottom, establishing competition between benthic macrophytes and phytoplankton, more complex trophic networks and stronger top-down regulation leading to alternative stable states and possible regime shifts between them. Clear lakes in macrophyte-dominated states support higher biodiversity than phytoplankton-dominated eutrophic lakes. Deep lakes are more dependent on planktonic primary production, which supports zooplankton, benthic microbial and invertebrate detritivores. Herbivorous fish and zooplankton regulate the main primary producers (biofilms and phytoplankton). The main predators are fish, macroinvertebrates, amphibians and birds, many of which have specialised feeding traits tied to different habitat niches (e.g. benthic or pelagic),
but there are few filter-feeders. In many regions, shallow lakes provide critical breeding habitat for waterbirds, amphibians, and reptiles, while visiting mammals transfer nutrients, organic matter and biota.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These lakes may be hydrologically isolated, groundwater-dependent or connected to rivers as terminal or flow-through systems. Nutrients depend on catchment size and substrates. Some lakes (e.g. on leached coastal sandplains or peaty landscapes) have dystrophic waters. The seasonality and amount of inflow, size, depth (mixing regime and light penetration), pH, nutrients, salinity
and tanins shape lake ecology and biota. Seasonal cycles of temperature, inflow and wind (which drive vertical mixing) may generate monomictic or dimictic temperature stratification regimes in deeper lakes, while shallow lakes are polymicitic, sometimes with short periods of multiple stratification. Seasonal factors, such as light, increases in temperature and flows into lakes, can induce breeding and recruitment.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mainly in humid temperate and tropical regions, rarely semi-arid or arid zones.

# F2.3 Seasonal freshwater lakes

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These small (mostly &lt;5 km2 in area) and shallow (&lt;2 m deep) seasonal freshwater lakes, vernal pools, turloughs, or gnammas (panholes, rock pools), are characterised by a seasonal aquatic biota. Local endemism may be high in lakes where hydrological isolation promotes biotic insularity, which occurs in some Mediterranean climate regions. Autochthonous energy sources are supplemented by limited allochthonous inputs from small catchments and groundwater. Seasonal variation in biota and productivity outweighs inter- annual variation, unlike in ephemeral lakes (F2.5 and F2.7). Filling induces microbial activity, the germination of seeds and algal spores, hatching and emergence of invertebrates, and growth and reproduction by specialists and opportunistic colonists. Wind-induced mixing oxygenates the water, but eutrophic
or unmixed waters may become anoxic and dominated by air-breathers as peak productivity and biomass fuel high biological oxygen demand. Anoxia may be abated diurnally
by photosynthetic activity. Resident biota persists through seasonal drying on lake margins or in sediments as desiccation- resistant dormant or quiescent life stages, for example, crayfish may retreat to burrows that extend to the water table, turtles may aestivate in sediments or fringing vegetation, amphibious perennial plants may persist on lake margins or in seedbanks. Trophic networks and niche diversity are driven by bottom-up processes, especially submerged and emergent macrophytes, and depend on productivity and lake size. Cyanobacteria,
algae and macrophytes are the major primary producers, while annual grasses may colonise dry lake beds. The most diverse lakes exhibit zonation and support phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrate consumers and seasonally resident amphibians (especially juvenile aquatic phases), waterbirds and mammals. Rock pools have simple trophic structure, based primarily on epilithic algae or macrophytes, and invertebrates, but no fish. Invertebrates and amphibians may reach high diversity and abundance in the absence of fish.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Annual filling and drying
are driven by seasonal rainfall, surface flows, groundwater fluctuation and seasonally high evapotranspiration. These lakes
are polymicitc, mixing continuously when filled. Impermeable substrates (e.g. clay or bedrock) impede infiltration in some lakes; in others groundwater percolates up through sand, peat or fissures in karstic limestone (turloughs). Small catchments, low-relief terrain, high area-to-volume ratios and hydrological isolation promote seasonal fluctuation. Most lakes are hydrologically isolated, but some become connected seasonally by sheet flows or drainage lines. These hydrogeomorphic features also limit nutrient supply, in turn limiting pH buffering. High rates of organic decomposition, denitrification, and sediment retention are driven by water fluctuations. High alkalinity reflects high anaerobic respiration. Groundwater flows may ameliorate hydrological isolation. Seasonal filling and drying induce spatio-temporal variability in temperature, depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity and nutrients, resulting in zonation within lakes and high variability among them.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mainly subhumid temperate and wet-dry tropical regions in monsoonal and Mediterranean-type climates but usually not semi-arid or arid regions.

# F2.4 Freeze-thaw freshwater lakes

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

The majority of surface of these lakes is frozen for at least a month in most years. Their varied origins (tectonic, riverine, fluvioglacial), size and depth affect composition and function. Allochthonous and autochthonous energy sources vary with lake and catchment features. Productivity is highly seasonal, sustained in winter largely by the metabolism of microbial photoautotrophs, chemautotrophs and zooplankton that remain active under low light, nutrients, and temperatures. Spring thaw initiates a seasonal succession, increasing productivity and re-establishing complex trophic networks, depending on lake area, depth, connectivity,
and nutrient availability. Diatoms are usually first to become photosynthetically active, followed by small and motile zooplankton, which respond to increased food availability,
and cyanobacteria later in summer when grazing pressure is high. Large lakes with high habitat complexity (i.e. Lake Baikal) support phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrophytes (in shallow waters), invertebrate consumers, migratory fish (in connected lakes), waterbirds, and mammals. Their upper trophic levels are more abundant, diverse, and endemic than in smaller lakes. Herbivorous fish and zooplankton are significant top-down regulators of the main primary producers (i.e. biofilms and phytoplankton). These, in turn, are regulated by predatory fish, which may be limited by prey availability and competition. The biota is spatially structured by seasonally dynamic gradients in cold stratification, light, nutrient levels, and turbulence. Traits, such as resting stages, dormancy, freeze-cued spore production in phytoplankton and the ability of fish to access low oxygen exchange, enable persistence through cold winters under the ice and through seasonal patterns of nutrient availability.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Seasonal freeze-thaw cycles typically generate dimictic temperature stratification regimes
(i.e. mixing twice per year), where cold water lies above warm water in winter and vice versa in summer. Shallow lakes may mix continuously (polymicitic) during the summer and may freeze completely during winter. Mixing occurs in autumn and spring.
Freezing reduces light penetration and turbulence, subduing summer depth gradients in temperature, oxygen, and nutrients. Ice also limits atmospheric inputs, including gas exchange. Very low temperatures reduce the growth rates, diversity, and abundance of fish. Many lakes are stream sources. Lake sizes vary from &lt;1 ha to more than 30,000 km2, profoundly affecting niche diversity and trophic complexity. Freezing varies with the area and depth of lakes. Thawing is often accompanied by flooding in spring, ameliorating light and temperature gradients, and increasing mixing. Dark-water inflows from peatlands in catchments influence water chemistry, light penetration, and productivity.

## DISTRIBUTION

Predominantly across the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and high altitudes of South America, New Zealand and Tasmania.

# F2.5 Ephemeral freshwater lakes

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Shallow ephemeral freshwater bodies are also known as depressions, playas, clay pans or pans. Long periods of low productivity during dry phases are punctuated by episodes of high production after filling. Trophic structure is relatively simple with mostly benthic, filamentous and planktonic algae, detritivorous and predatory zooplankton (e.g. rotifers and Daphnia), crustaceans, insects, and in some lakes, molluscs. The often high invertebrate biomass provides food for amphibians and itinerant waterbirds. Terrestrial mammals use the lakes to drink and bathe and may transfer nutrients, organic matter and ’hitch-hiking’ biota. Diversity may be high in boom phases but there are only a few local endemics (i.e. narrow- ranged charophytes). Specialised and opportunistic biota exploit boom-bust resource availability through life-cycle traits that confer tolerance to desiccation (i.e. desiccation-resistant eggs
in crustaceans) and/or enable rapid hatching, development, breeding and recruitment when water arrives. Much of the biota (i.e. opportunistic insects) have widely dispersing adult phases enabling rapid colonisation and re-colonisation. Filling events initiate succession with spikes of primary production, allowing short temporal windows for consumers to grow and reproduce and for itinerant predators to aggregate. Drying initiates senescence, dispersal and dormancy until the next filling event.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Arid climates have highly variable hydrology. Episodic inundation after rain is relatively short (days to months) due to high evaporation rates and infiltration. Drainage systems are closed or nearly so, with channels or sheet inflow from flat, sparsely vegetated catchments. Inflows bring allochthonous organic matter and nutrients and are typically turbid with fine particles. Clay-textured lake bottoms hold water by limiting percolation but may include sand particles. Bottom sediments release nutrients rapidly after filling and solute concentrations increase as drying progresses, placing these systems on a continuum with salt lakes. When filled, these lakes are shallow with small volumes, flat-bottomed and polymicitic, so light and oxygen are generally not limiting. Persistent turbidity may limit light but oxygen production by macrophytes and flocculation (i.e. clumping) from increasing salinity during drying reduce turbidity over time. Shallow depth promotes high daytime water temperatures (when filling in summer) and high diurnal temperature variability.

## DISTRIBUTION

Semi-arid and arid regions at mid-latitudes of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia.

# F2.6 Permanent salt and soda lakes

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These lakes are united by relatively constant, high inorganic solute concentrations (notably sodium ions) and an associated specialist biota. Unlike hypersaline lakes (F2.7), productivity is not suppressed Autotrophs may
be abundant, including phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, green algae and submerged and emergent macrophytes. These, supplemented by allochthonous energy and C inputs from lake catchments, support relatively simple trophic networks with few species in high abundance and some regional endemism. High biomass of archaeal and bacterial decomposers and phytoplankton in turn supports abundant consumers including brine shrimps, copepods, insects and other invertebrates, fish and waterbirds (i.e. flamingos). Predators and herbivores that become dominant at low salinity exert top-down control on algae and low-order consumers. Species niches are structured by spatial and temporal salinity gradients. Species in the
most saline conditions tend to have broader ranges of salinity tolerance. Increasing salinity generally reduces diversity and the importance of top-down trophic regulation but not necessarily the abundance of organisms, except at hypersaline levels. Many organisms tolerate high salinity through osmotic regulation (at a high metabolic cost), limiting productivity and competitive ability.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Lakes may be thousands of hectares in size and several metres deep. A few are larger and deeper (i.e. Caspian Sea), while some volcanic lakes are small and deep. Endorheic drainage promotes salt accumulation,
but lake volume and reliable water inflows buffer salinity below extreme levels, despite high evaporation. Salt lakes are mostly legacies of marine incursions (since retreated) and dominated by sodium chloride (cf. seawater). Soda lakes derive more diverse solutes from catchment leachates, with sodium carbonate or sulphate dominant. Salinity varies temporally from 0.3% to
rarely more than 10% depending on lake size, temperature, and the balance between freshwater inflows, precipitation, and evaporation. Ionic composition and concentration varies greatly among lakes due to differences in groundwater and inflow, with carbonate, sulphate, sulphide, ammonia and/or phosphorus sometimes reaching high levels, and pH varying from 3 to 11. Inflow is critical to ecosystem dynamics, partly by driving the indirect effects of salinity on trophic or engineering processes. Groundwater also contributes to water balance and chemistry. Ionic concentrations may be vertically stratified (i.e. meromictic), often seasonally, due to slow mixing after periodic inflows episodes of low-density freshwater. Dissolved oxygen
is inversely related to salinity, so anoxia is common at depth in meromictic lakes.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mostly in semi-arid regions of Africa, southern Australia, Eurasia, Europe, and western parts of North and South America.

# F2.7 Ephemeral salt lakes

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Ephemeral salt lakes or playas have relatively short-lived wet phases and long dry periods of years to decades. During filling phases, inflow dilutes salinity to moderate levels, and allochthonous energy and carbon inputs from lake catchments supplement autochthonous energy produced
by abundant phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, submerged and emergent macrophytes, and fringing halophytes. In drying phases, increasing salinity generally reduces diversity and top-down trophic regulation, but not necessarily the abundance of organisms, except at hypersaline levels, which suppress productivity. Trophic networks are simple and characterised by few species that are often highly abundant during wet phases. The high biomass of archaeal and bacterial decomposers and phytoplankton in turn support abundant consumers, including crustaceans (i.e. brine shrimps and copepods), insects and other invertebrates, fish and specialist waterbirds (e.g. banded stilts, flamingos). Predators and herbivores that dominate at low salinity levels exert top-down control on algae and low-order consumers. Species niches are strongly structured by spatial and temporal salinity gradients and endorheic drainage promotes regional endemism. Species that persist in the most saline conditions tend to have broad salinity tolerance. Many organisms regulate salinity osmotically at a high metabolic cost, limiting productivity and competitive ability. Many specialised opportunists are able to exploit boom-bust resource cycles through life-cycle traits that promote persistence during dry periods (e.g. desiccation-resistant eggs in crustaceans and/ or rapid hatching, development, breeding and recruitment). Much of the biota (e.g. insects and birds) have widely dispersed adult phases enabling rapid colonisation. Filling events drive specialised succession, with short windows of opportunity to grow and reproduce reset by drying until the next filling event.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Up to 10,000 km2 in area and usually less than a few metres deep, these lakes may be weakly stratified (i.e. meromictic) due to the slow mixing of freshwater inflow. Endorheic drainage promotes salt accumulation. Salinity varies from 0.3% up to 40% through wet-dry phases depending on lake size, depth, temperature, hydrochemistry, and the dynamic balance between freshwater inflow, groundwater, precipitation and evaporation. Inflow and groundwater are critical to ecosystem dynamics, mediate wet-dry phases, and drive the indirect effects of salinity on trophic and ecosystem processes. Dissolved oxygen is inversely related to salinity, hence anoxia is common in drying hypersaline lake states.
Ionic composition varies, with carbonate, sulphate, sulphide, ammonia, arsenic, boron and/or phosphorus sometimes at high levels, and pH varying from 3 to 11.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mostly in arid and semi-arid Africa, Eurasia, Australia, and North and South America.

# F2.8 Artesian springs and oases

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

Ubari Oasis, Wadi Al Hayaa District, southwestern Libya.

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These groundwater-dependent systems are fed by artesian waters that discharge to the surface. They are.surrounded by dry landscapes and receive little surface inflow, being predominantly disconnected from surface-stream networks. Insularity from the broader landscape results in high levels of endemism in sedentary aquatic biota, which are likely descendants of relic species from a wetter past. Springs may be spatially clustered due to their association
with geological features such as faults or outcropping aquifers. Even springs in close proximity may have distinct physical and biological differences. Some springs have outflow streams, which may support different assemblages of plants and invertebrates to those in the spring orifice. Artesian springs
and oases tend to have simple trophic structures. Autotrophs include aquatic algae and floating vascular plants, with emergent amphibious plants in shallow waters. Terrestrial plants around the perimeter contribute subsidies of organic matter and nutrients through litter fall. Consumers and predators include crustaceans, molluscs, arachnids, insects and small-bodied fish. Most biota are poorly dispersed and have continuous life cycles and other traits specialised for persistence in hydrologically stable, warm, or hot mineral-rich water. Springs and oases are reliable watering points for wide-ranging birds and mammals, which function as mobile links for resources and promote the dispersal of other biota between isolated wetlands in the dryland matrix.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Flow of artesian water to
the surface is critical to these wetlands, which receive little input from precipitation or runoff. Hydrological variability is low compared to other wetland types, but hydrological connections with deep regional aquifers, basin-fill sediments and local watershed recharge drive lagged flow dynamics. Flows vary over geological timeframes, with evidence of cyclic growth, waning and extinction. Discharge waters tend to have elevated temperatures, are polymicitic and enriched in minerals that
reflect their geological origins. The precipitation of dissolved minerals (i.e. carbonates) and deposition by wind and water form characteristic cones or mounds known as “mound springs”. Perennial flows and hydrological isolation from other spatially and temporally restricted surface waters make these wetlands important ecological refuges in arid landscapes.

## DISTRIBUTION

Scattered throughout arid regions in southern Africa, the Sahara, the Middle East, central Eurasia, southwest of North America and Australia’s Great Artesian Basin, but may also occur in humid landscapes.

# F2.9 Geothermal pools and wetlands

BIOME: F2 LAKES 
REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These hot springs, geysers, mud
pots and associated wetlands result from interactions of deeply circulating groundwater with magma and hot rocks that produce chemically precipitated substrates. They support a specialised but low-diversity biota structured by extreme thermal and geochemical gradients. Energy is almost entirely autochthonous, productivity is low and trophic networks are very simple. Primary producers include chemoautotrophic bacteria and archaea,
as well as photoautotrophic cyanobacteria, diatoms, algae
and macrophytes. Thermophilic and metallophilic microbes dominate the most extreme environments in vent pools, while mat-forming green algae and animal-protists occur in warm acidic waters. Thermophilic blue-green algae reach optimum growth above 45°C. Diatoms occur in less acidic warm waters. Aquatic macrophytes occur on sinter aprons and wetlands
with temperatures below 35°C. Herbivores are scarce, allowing thick algal mats to develop. These are inhabited by invertebrate detritivores, notably dipterans and coleopterans, which may tolerate temperatures up to 55°C. Molluscs and crustaceans occupy less extreme microhabitats (notably in hard water hot springs), as do vertebrates, such as amphibians, fish, snakes and visiting birds. Microinvertebrates such as rotifers and ostracods are common. Invertebrates, snakes and fish exhibit some endemism due to habitat insularity. Specialised physiological traits enabling metabolic function in extreme temperatures include thermophilic proteins with short amino-acid lengths, chaperone molecules that assist protein folding, branched chain fatty acids and polyamines for membrane stabilisation, DNA repair systems and upregulated glycolysis providing energy
to regulate heat stress. Three mechanisms enable metabolic function in extremely acidic (pH&lt;3) geothermal waters: i) proton efflux via active transport pumps that counter proton influx; ii) decreased permeability of cell membranes to suppress proton entry into the cytoplasm; and iii) strong protein and DNA repair systems. Similar mechanisms enable metabolic function in waters with high concentrations of metal toxins. A succession
of animal and plant communities occur with distance from the spring source as temperatures cool and minerals precipitate.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Continual flows of geothermal groundwater sustain these polymicitic water bodies. Permanent surface waters may be clear or highly turbid with suspended solids as in ‘mud volcanoes’. Water temperatures vary from hot (&gt;44°C) to extreme (&gt;80°C) on local gradients (e.g. vent pools, geysers, mounds, sinter aprons, terraces and outflow streams). The pH is either extremely acid (2–4) or neutral-alkaline (7–11). Mineral salts are concentrated, but composition varies greatly among sites with properties of the underlying bedrock. Dissolved and precipitated minerals include very high concentrations of silicon, calcium or iron, but also arsenic, antimony, copper,
zinc, cadmium, lead, polonium or mercury, usually as oxides, sulphides or sulphates, but nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, may be scarce.

## DISTRIBUTION

Tectonically or volcanically active areas from tropical to subpolar latitudes. Notable examples in Yellowstone (USA), Iceland, New Zealand, Atacama (Chile), Japan and east Africa.

# F2.10 Subglacial lakes

REALM: FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Remarkable lacustrine ecosystems occur beneath permanent ice sheets. They are placed within the Lakes biome (F2) due to their relationships with some Freeze-thaw lakes (F2.4), but they share several key features with the Subterranean freshwater biome (SF1). Evidence of their existence first emerged in 1973 from airborne radar-echo sounding imagery, which penetrates the ice cover and shows lakes as uniformly flat structures with high basal reflectivity.
The biota of these ecosystems is very poorly known due to technological limitations on access and concerns about the risk of contamination from coring. Only a few shallow lakes up to
1 km beneath ice have been surveyed (e.g. Lake Whillams in West Antarctica and Grímsvötn Lake in Iceland). The exclusively microbial trophic web is truncated, with no photoautotrophs and apparently few multi-cellular predators, but taxonomic diversity is high across bacteria and archaea, with some eukaryotes
also represented. Chemosynthesis form the base of the trophic web, chemolithoautotrophic species using reduced Nitrogen, Iron and Sulphur and methane in energy-generating metabolic pathways. The abundance of micro-organisms is comparable
to that in groundwater (SF1.2) (104 – 105 cells.ml-1), with diverse morphotypes represented, including long and short filaments, thin and thick rods, spirals, vibrio, cocci and diplococci. Subglacial lakes share several biotic traits with extremophiles within ice (T6.1), subterranean waters (SF1.1, SF1.2) and deep oceans (e.g. M2.3, M2.4, M3.3), including very low productivity, slow growth rates, large cell sizes and aphotic energy synthesis. Although microbes of the few surveyed subglacial lakes, and from accreted ice which has refrozen from lake water, have
DNA profiles similar to those of other contemporary microbes, the biota in deeper disconnected lake waters and associated lake-floor sediments could be highly relictual if it evolved in stable isolation over millions of years under extreme selection pressures.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Subglacial lakes vary in size from less than 1 km2 to ~10,000 km2, and most are 10–20 m deep, but Lake Vostok (Antarctica) is at least 1,000 m deep. The environment is characterised by high isostatic pressure (up to ~350 atmospheres), constant cold temperatures marginally below 0°C, low-nutrient levels, and an absence of sunlight. Oxygen concentrations can be high due to equilibration with
gas hydrates from the melting ice sheet base ice, but declines with depth in amictic lakes due to limited mixing, depending on convection gradients generated by cold meltwater from the ice ceiling and geothermal heating from below. Chemical weathering of basal debris is the main source of nutrients supplemented by ice melt.

## DISTRIBUTION

Some ~400 subglacial lakes in Antarctica, ~60 in Greenland and a few in Iceland and Canada have been identified from radar remote sensing and modelling.
