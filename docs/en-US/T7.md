# T7 Intensive land-use biome

Tea plantation in Ciwidey, Bandung, Indonesia.

Intensive land-use systems include major anthropogenic enterprises of cropping, pastoralism, plantation farming, and urbanisation. Human intervention is a dominating influence
on this biome, also known as the ‘anthrome’. Maintenance of these systems is contingent on continuing human interventions, including alterations to the physical structure of vegetation
and substrates (e.g. clearing, earthworks and drainage), the supplementation of resources (e.g. with irrigation and fertilisers) and the introduction and control of biota. These interventions maintain disequilibrium community structure and composition, low endemism and low functional and taxonomic diversity. Target biota are genetically manipulated (by selective breeding or molecular engineering) to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, predators and diseases. Non-target biota include widely dispersed, cosmopolitan opportunists with short lifecycles. Many intensive land use systems are maintained
as artificial mosaics of contrasting patch types at scales of metres to hundreds of metres. Typically, but not exclusively,
they are associated with temperate or subtropical climates and the natural availability of freshwater and nutrients from fertile soils on flat to undulating terrain accessible by machinery. The antecedent ecosystems that they replaced include forests, shrublands, grasslands and palustrine wetlands (biomes
T1−T4 and TF1). On global and regional scales, intensive land- use systems are engaged in climate feedback processes via alterations to the water cycle and the release of greenhouse gases from vegetation, soils, livestock and fossil fuels. On local scales, temperatures may be modified by human-built structures (i.e. heat-island effects) or may be artificially controlled.

# T7.1 Annual croplands

BIOME: T7 INTENSIVE ANTHROPOGENIC TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL


## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Structurally simple, very low- diversity, high-productivity annual croplands are maintained
by the intensive anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients, water and artificial disturbance regimes (i.e. annual cultivation), translocation (i.e. sowing) and harvesting of annual plants. These systems are dominated by one or few shallow-rooted annual plant species, such as grains (mostly C3 grasses), vegetables, ‘flowers’, legumes, or fibre species harvested annually by humans for commercial or subsistence production of food, materials or ornamental displays. Disequilibrium community structure and composition is maintained by translocations and/ or managed reproduction of target species and the periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores and/or pathogens. Consequently, these systems have very low functional, genetic and taxonomic diversity and no local endemism. Productivity
is highly sensitive to variations in resource availability. Target biota are genetically manipulated by selective breeding or molecular engineering to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions,
insect predators and diseases. Croplands may be rotated inter- annually with livestock pastures or fallow fields (T7.2). Target biota coexists with a cosmopolitan ruderal biota (e.g. weedy plants, mice and starlings) that exploits production landscapes opportunistically through efficient dispersal, itinerant foraging, rapid establishment, high fecundity and rapid population turnover. When actively managed systems are abandoned or managed less intensively, these non-target biota, especially non- woody plants, become dominant and may form a steady, self- maintaining state or a transitional phase to novel ecosystems.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The high to moderate natural availability of water (from at least seasonally high rainfall) and nutrients (from fertile soils) is supplemented by human inputs via irrigation, landscape drainage modifications (i.e. surface earthworks) and/or fertiliser application by humans. Intermittent flooding may occur where croplands replace palustrine wetlands. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. These systems are typically associated with flat to moderate terrain accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (i.e. annual ploughing) maintain soil turnover, aeration, nutrient release and relatively low soil organic carbon content.

## DISTRIBUTION

Tropical to temperate humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across south sub-Saharan and North Africa, Europe, Asia, southern Australia, Oceania, and the Americas.

# T7.2 Sown pastures and fields

BIOME: T7 INTENSIVE ANTHROPOGENIC TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Structurally simple, low-diversity, high-productivity pastures are maintained by the intensive anthropogenic supplementation of nutrients (more rarely water) and artificial disturbance regimes (i.e. periodic ploughing,), translocation (e.g. sowing and livestock movement) and harvesting of animals or plants. They are dominated by one or few selected plant species (C3 and C4 perennial pasture grasses and/or herbaceous legumes) and animal species (usually large mammalian herbivores) for commercial production of food or materials, ornamental displays, or, rarely, subsistence. Their composition and structure is maintained by the translocation and/or managed reproduction of target species and the
periodic application of herbicides and pesticides and/or culling to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores or pathogens. Consequently, these systems have low functional and taxonomic diversity and no local endemism. Target biota are genetically manipulated to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, predators
and diseases. They are harvested by humans continuously or periodically for consumption. Major examples include intensively managed production pastures for livestock or forage (i.e. hay), lawns, and sporting fields. Livestock pastures may be rotated inter-annually with non-woody crops (T7.1). Target biota coexist with a cosmopolitan ruderal biota that exploits production landscapes through efficient dispersal, rapid establishment, high fecundity and rapid population turnover. When the ecosystem
is abandoned or managed less intensively, non-target biota become dominant and may form a steady, self-maintaining state or a transitional phase to novel ecosystems.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

High to moderate natural availability of water and nutrients is supplemented by human inputs via water management, landscape drainage modifications (i.e. surface earthworks) and/or fertiliser application. Intermittent flooding may occur where pastures replace palustrine wetlands. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. Typically associated with moderately fertile substrates, and flat to undulating terrain accessible by machinery. Artificial disturbance regimes (i.e. ploughing for up to five years per decade) maintain soil turnover, aeration and nutrient release.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mostly in subtropical to temperate climatic zones and developed countries across Europe, east and south Asia, subtropical and temperate Africa, southern Australasia, north and central America, and temperate south America.

# T7.3 Plantations

BIOME: T7 INTENSIVE ANTHROPOGENIC TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These moderate to high productivity autotrophic systems are established by the translocation (i.e. planting or seeding) of woody perennial plants. Target biota may be genetically manipulated by selective breeding or molecular engineering to promote rapid growth rates, efficient resource capture, enhanced resource allocation to production tissues, and tolerance of harsh environmental conditions, insect predators and diseases. The diversity, structure, composition, function and successional trajectory of the ecosystem depends on the identity, developmental stage, density and traits
(e.g. phenology, physiognomy and growth rates) of planted species, as well as the subsequent management of plantation development. Most plantations comprise at least two vertical strata (the managed woody species and a ruderal ground
layer). Mixed forest plantings may be more complex and host
a relatively diverse flora and fauna if managed to promote habitat features. Cyclical harvest may render the habitat periodically unsuitable for some biota. Mixed cropping systems may comprise two vertical strata of woody crops or a woody and herbaceous layer. Secondary successional processes involve colonisation and regeneration, initially of opportunistic biota. Successional feedbacks occur as structural complexity increases, promoting visits or colonisation by vertebrates and the associated dispersal of plants and other organisms. Crop replacement (which may occur on inter-annual or decadal cycles), the intensive management of plantation structure, or
the control of non-target species may reset, arrest, or redirect successional processes. Examples with increasing management intervention include: environmental plantations established
for wildlife or ecosystem services; agroforestry plantings for subsistence products or livestock benefits; forestry plantations for timber, pulp, fibre, bio-energy, rubber, or oils; and vineyards, orchards and other perennial food crops (e.g. cassava,
coffee, tea, palm oil and nuts). Secondary (regrowth) forests and shrublands are not included as plantations even where management includes supplementary translocations.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

High to moderate natural availability of water and nutrients is supplemented by human inputs of fertiliser or mulch, landscape drainage modifications (i.e. surface earthworks) and, in intensively managed systems, irrigation. Rainfall is at least seasonally high. Temperatures are mild to warm, at least seasonally. Artificial disturbance regimes involving the complete or partial removal of biomass and soil turnover are implemented at sub-decadal to multi-decadal frequencies.

## DISTRIBUTION

Tropical to cool temperate humid climatic zones or river flats in dry climates across south sub-Saharan and Mediterranean Africa, Europe, Asia, southern Australia, Oceania and the Americas.

# T7.4 Urban and industrial ecosystems

BIOME: T7 INTENSIVE ANTHROPOGENIC TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These systems are structurally complex and highly heterogeneous fine-scale spatial mosaics
of diverse patch types that may be recognised in fine-scale
land use classifications. These elements include: i) buildings;
ii) paved surfaces; iii) transport infrastructure; iv) treed areas;
v) grassed areas; vi) gardens; vii) mines or quarries; viii) bare ground; and ix) refuse areas. Patch mosaics are dynamic over decadal time scales and driven by socio-ecological feedbacks and a human population that is highly stratified, functionally, socially and economically. Interactions among patch types and human social behaviours produce emergent properties and complex feedbacks among components within each system and interactions with other ecosystem types. Unlike most other terrestrial ecosystems, the energy, water and nutrient sources
of urban systems are highly allochthonous and processes within urban systems drive profound and extensive global changes
in land use, land cover, biodiversity, hydrology and climate through both resource consumption and waste discharge.
Biotic community structure is characterised by low functional and taxonomic diversity, highly skewed rank-abundance relationships and relict local endemism. Trophic networks are simplified and sparse and each node is dominated by few taxa. Urban biota include humans, dependents (e.g. companion animals and cultivars), opportunists and vagrants, and legacy biota whose establishment pre-dates urbanisation. Many biota have highly plastic realised niches, traits enabling wide dispersal, high fecundity and short generation times. The persistence of dependent biota is maintained by human-assisted migration, managed reproduction, genetic manipulation, amelioration
of temperatures, and intensive supplementation of nutrients, food and water. Pest biota are controlled by the application of herbicides and pesticides or culling with collateral impacts on non-target biota.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Humans influence the availability of water, nutrients, and energy through governance systems for resource importation and indirectly through interactions and feedbacks. Light is enhanced artificially at night.
Urban temperature regimes are elevated by the anthropogenic conversion of chemical energy to heat and the absorption
of solar energy by buildings and paved surfaces. However, temperatures may be locally ameliorated within buildings. Surface water runoff is enhanced and percolation is reduced
by sealed surfaces. Chemical and particulate air pollution, as well as light and noise pollution, may affect biota. Infrastructure development and renewal, driven by socio-economic processes, as well as natural disasters (e.g. storms, floods, earthquakes and tsunami), create recurring disturbances. There is frequent movement of humans and associated biota and matter between cities.

## DISTRIBUTION

Extensively scattered through equatorial
to subpolar latitudes from sea-level to submontane altitudes, mostly in proximity to the coast, rivers or lakes, especially in North America, Western Europe and Japan, as well as India, China and Brazil. Land use maps depict fine-scale patch types listed above.

# T7.5 Derived semi-natural pastures and old fields

BIOME: T7 INTENSIVE ANTHROPOGENIC TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS 
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Extensive ‘semi-natural’ grasslands and open shrublands exist where woody components
of vegetation have been removed or greatly modified for agricultural land uses. Hence they have been ‘derived’ from
a range of other ecosystems (mostly from biomes T1-T4, a
few from T5). Remaining vegetation includes a substantial component of local indigenous species, as well as an introduced exotic element, providing habitat for a mixed indigenous and non-indigenous fauna. Although structurally simpler than the systems from which they were derived, they often harbour an appreciable diversity of native organisms, including some no longer present in ‘natural’ ecosystems. Dominant plant growth forms include tussock or stoloniferous grasses and forbs, with or without non-vascular plants, shrubs and scattered trees. These support microbial decomposers and diverse invertebrate groups that function as detritivores, herbivores and predators, as well as vertebrate herbivores and predators characteristic
of open habitats. Energy sources are primarily autochthonous, with varying levels of indirect allochthonous subsidies (i.e.
via surface water sheet flows), but few managed inputs (cf. T7.2). Productivity can be low-high, depending on climate
and substrate, but is generally lower and more stable than
more intensive anthropogenic systems (T7.1-T7.3). Trophic networks include all levels, but complexity and diversity depends on the species pool, legacies from antecedent ecosystems, successional stage and management regimes. These novel ecosystems may persist in a steady self-maintaining state, or undergo passive transformation (i.e. oldfield succession), unless actively maintained in disequilibrium. For example, removal of domestic herbivores may initiate transition to tree-dominated ecosystems.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Availability of water and nutrients varies depending on local climate, substrate and terrain (hence surface water movement and infiltration). The structure, function and composition of these ecosystems are shaped by legacy features of antecedent systems from which they were derived, as well as ongoing and past human activities. These activities may reflect production and/or conservation goals, or abandonment. They include active removal of woody vegetation, management of vertebrate herbivores, introductions of biota, control of ‘pest’ biota, manipulation of disturbance regimes, drainage and earthworks, etc. Fertilisers and pesticides are not commonly applied.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mostly in temperate to tropical climatic zones across all land masses.
