The Shoreline systems biome comprises naturally formed, intertidal abiogenic habitats situated at the interface between land and sea. The distribution of the biome spans all latitudes (temperate to polar) at which landmasses are present. Productivity ranges from high to low, is loosely proportional to the availability of stable hard substrate for macrophyte attachment and inversely proportional to the dependency
on allochthonous energy sources derived from both land
and sea. Productivity is also influenced by coastal upwelling and, for ecotypes of finer particle size, the nutrient content of adjacent terrestrial sediments. Within and across ecotypes, biotic communities are strongly structured by tides, waves and particle size, ranging from contiguous rock to fine silts and clays. Notably, some shorelines comprise mixed hard and soft substrates, with vertical zonation varying temporally in response to storm events and redeposition of soft sediments. Tides produce a vertical gradient of increasing aerial exposure
across which desiccation and temperature stress increase,
time available for filter-feeding decreases, and interactions
with marine and terrestrial predators vary. Waves and particle size determine substrate stability and the physical disturbance regime. Wave action, diminishing from headlands to bays, produces horizontal gradients in community structure. Many organisms possess morphological and behavioural adaptations to prevent desiccation at low tide and dislodgement by wave forces. Burrowing animals are important in unconsolidated sediments. Competition (especially for space) is a major factor structuring communities, with its importance diminishing with decreasing particle size. Facilitative interactions (particularly those that protect organisms from desiccation stress or physical disturbance) can be important across ecosystems of all particle sizes. Biodiversity is generally high, with microscopic lifeforms dominating the biomass of systems of small particle size.

# MT1.1 Rocky shorelines 

BIOME: MT1 SHORELINE SYSTEMS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL MARINE-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These intertidal benthic systems, composed of sessile and mobile species, are highly structured by fine-scale resource and stress gradients, as well as trade- offs among competitive, facilitation and predatory interactions. Sessile algae and invertebrates form complex three-dimensional habitats that provide microhabitat refugia from desiccation and temperature stress for associated organisms; these weaken competitive interactions. The biota exhibit behavioural and morphological adaptions to minimise exposure to stressors, such as seeking shelter in protective microhabitats at low
tide, possessing exoskeletons (i.e. shells), or producing mucous to reduce desiccation. In wave-swept environments, adaptations include morphologies, such as small body sizes and small cross-sectional areas to minimise drag. Key trophic groups include filter-feeders (which feed on phytoplankton
and dissolved organic matter at high tide), grazers (which scrape microphytobenthos and macroalgal spores from rock or consume macroalgal thalli), and resident (e.g. starfish, whelks and crabs) and transient (e.g. birds and fish) marine and terrestrial predators. Rocky shores display high endemism relative to other coastal systems and frequently display high productivity due to the large amounts of light they receive, although this can vary according to nutrient availability from upwelling and terrestrial runoff.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Tides and waves are the key ecological drivers, producing resource availability and physical disturbance gradients vertically and horizontally, respectively. Across the vertical gradient of increasing aerial exposure, desiccation and temperature stress increases, time available
for filter-feeding decreases, and interactions with marine and terrestrial predators vary. Horizontal gradients of diminishing salinity and wave exposure from headlands to bays or inlets influences community composition and morphology. Many organisms rely on microhabitats formed from natural rock features (e.g. crevices, depressions and rock pools) or habitat- forming species (e.g. canopy-forming algae, mussels, oysters, and barnacles) to persist in an environment that would otherwise exceed their environmental tolerances. Rocky shores are open systems, so community structure can be influenced by larval supply, coastal upwelling and competition. Competition for space may limit the lower vertical distributions of some sessile species. The limited space available for the growth of marine primary producers can result in competition for food among grazers. Disturbances (i.e. storms, ice scour on subpolar shores) that free-up space can have a strong influence on community structure and diversity.

## DISTRIBUTION

Found globally at the margins of oceans where waves are eroding rocks. They are the most common ecosystems on open, high-energy coasts and also occur on many sheltered and enclosed coastlines, such as sea lochs, fjords and rias.

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Highly productive intertidal environments are defined by their fine particle size (dominated by silts) and are fuelled largely by allochthonous production. Benthic diatoms are the key primary producer, although ephemeral intertidal seagrass may occur. Otherwise, macrophytes are generally absent unlike other ecosystems on intertidal mudfalts (MFT 1.2, MFT1.3). Fauna are dominated
by deposit-feeding taxa (consuming organic matter that accumulates in the fine-grained sediments) and detritivores feeding on wrack (i.e. drift algae deposited at the high-water mark) and other sources of macro-detritus. Bioturbating and tube-dwelling taxa are key ecosystem engineers, the former oxygenating and mixing the sediments and the latter providing structure to an otherwise sedimentary habitat. Infauna residing within sediments are protected from high temperatures and desiccation by the surrounding matrix, and do not display
the same marked patterns of zonation as rocky intertidal communities. Many infaunal taxa are soft-bodied. Nevertheless, competition for food resources carried by incoming tides can lead to intertidal gradients in fauna. Predators include the substantial shorebird populations that forage on infauna at low tide, including migratory species that depend on these systems as stopover sites. Fish, rays, crabs and resident whelks forage around lugworm bioturbation. Transitions to mangrove (MFT1.2), saltmarsh or reedbed (MFT1.3) ecosystems may occur in response to isostatic or sea level changes, freshwater inputs or changes in currents that promote macrophyte colonisation.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These are depositional environments influenced by sediment supply and the balance of erosion and sedimentation. They occur on lower wave energy coastlines with lower slopes and larger intertidal ranges than sandy shorelines, resulting in lower levels of sediment transport and oxygenation by physical processes. In the absence of burrowing taxa, sediments may display low rates of turnover, which may result in an anoxic zone close to the sediment surface. Small particle sizes limit interstitial spaces, further reducing aeration. The depth of the anoxic zone can be a key structuring factor. In contrast to sandy shorelines, they are organically rich and consequently higher in nutrients. Generally, muddy shorelines are formed from sediments supplied by nearby rivers, often remobilised from the seafloor throughout the tidal cycle.

## DISTRIBUTION

Muddy shorelines occur along low-energy coastlines, in estuaries and embayments where the velocity of water is so low that the finest particles can settle to the bottom.

# MT1.3 Sandy Shorelines

BIOME: MT1 SHORELINE SYSTEMS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL MARINE-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Sandy shorelines include beaches, sand bars and spits. These intertidal systems typically lack macrophytes, with their low productivity largely underpinned
by detrital subsidies dominated by wrack (i.e. drift seaweed accumulating at the high-water mark) and phytoplankton, particularly in the surf zone of dissipative beaches. Salt- and drought-tolerant primary producers dominate adjacent dune systems (MT2.1). Meio-faunal biomass in many instances exceeds macrofaunal biomass. In the intertidal zone, suspension-feeding is a more common foraging strategy among invertebrates than deposit-feeding, although detritivores may dominate higher on the shore where wrack accumulates. Invertebrate fauna are predominantly interstitial, with bacteria, protozoans and small metazoans contributing to the trophic network. Sediments are constantly shifting and thus invertebrate fauna are dominated by mobile taxa that display an ability to burrow and/or swash-ride up and down the beach face with
the tides. The transitional character of these systems supports marine and terrestrial invertebrates and itinerant vertebrates from marine waters (i.e. egg-laying turtles) and from terrestrial or transitional habitats (i.e. shorebirds foraging on invertebrates or foxes foraging on carrion).

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Physical factors are generally more important ecological drivers than biological factors.
Sand grain size (>85% grains 0.0625-2mm diam.), wave
and tidal regimes, and their relative energy, determine beach morphology, all of which influence the spatial and temporal availability of resources and niche diversity. Particle size is influenced by sediment sources as well as physical conditions and affects interstitial habitat structure. Wave action maintains substrate instability and an abundant supply of oxygen through turbulence. Tides and currents influence the dispersal of biota and regulate daily cycles of desiccation and hydration as well as salinity. Beach morphology ranges from narrow and steep (i.e. reflective) to wide and flat (i.e. dissipative) as sand becomes finer and waves and tides larger. Reflective beaches are accretional and more prevalent in the tropics; dissipative beaches are erosional and more common in temperate regions. Sands filter large volumes of seawater, with the volume greater on reflective than dissipative beaches. Beaches are linked to nearshore surf zones and coastal dunes through the storage, transport, and exchange of sand. Sand transport is the highest in exposed surf zones and sand storage the greatest in well-developed dunes.

## DISTRIBUTION

Sandy shores are most extensive at temperate latitudes, accounting for 31% of the ice-free global coastline, including 66% of the African coast and 23% of the European coast.

# MT1.4 Boulder and cobble shores

BIOME: MT1 SHORELINE SYSTEMS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL MARINE-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These low-productivity, net heterotrophic systems are founded on unstable rocky substrates and share some ecological features with sandy beaches (MT1.3) and rocky shores (MT1.1). Traits of the biota reflect responses
to regular substrate disturbance by waves and exposure of particles to desiccation and high temperatures. For example, in the high intertidal zone of boulder shores (where temperature and desiccation stress is most pronounced), fauna may be predominantly nocturnal. On cobble beaches, fauna are more abundant on the sub-surface because waves cause cobbles
to grind against each other, damaging or killing attached fauna. Conversely, on sandy beaches (MT1.3), most fauna occupy surface sediments. Intermediate frequencies of disturbance
lead to the greatest biodiversity. Only species with low tenacity (i.e. top shells) are found in surface sediments because they
can detach and temporarily inhabit deeper interstices during disturbance events. High-tenacity species (i.e. limpets) or
sessile species (e.g. macroalgae and barnacles) are more
readily damaged, hence rare on cobble shores. Large boulders, however, are only disturbed during large storms and have more stable temperatures, so more fauna can persist on their surface. Encrusting organisms may cement boulders on the low shore, further stabilising them in turbulent water. Allochthonous wrack is the major source of organic matter on cobble beaches, but in situ autotrophs include superficial algae and vascular vegetation dominated by halophytic forbs. On some cobble beaches of New England, USA, extensive intertidal beds of the cordgrass Spartina alterniflora stabilise cobbles and provide shade, facilitating establishment of mussels, barnacles, gastropods, amphipods, crabs and algae. In stabilising cobbles and buffering wave energy, cordgrass may also facilitate plants higher on the intertidal shore.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Particle size (e.g. cobbles vs. boulders) and wave activity determine substrate mobility, hence the frequency of physical disturbance to biota. Ecosystem engineers modify these relationships by stabilising the substrate. Cobble beaches are typically steep because waves easily
flow through large interstices between coarse beach particles, reducing the effects of backwash erosion. Hence swash and breaking zones tend to be similar widths. The permeability of cobble beaches leads to desiccation and heat stress at low
tide along the beach surface gradient. Desiccation stress is extreme on boulder shores, playing a similar role in structuring communities as on rocky shores. The extent of the fine sediment matrix present amongst cobbles, water supply (i.e. rainfall)
and the frequency of physical disturbance all influence beach vegetation. Alongshore grading of sediment by size could occur on long, drift dominated shorelines which may influence sediment calibre on the beach.

## DISTRIBUTION

Cobble beaches occur where rivers or glaciers delivered cobbles to the coast or where they were eroded from nearby coastal cliffs. They are most common
in Europe and also occur in Bahrain, North America, and New Zealand’s South Island.
