# T6 Polar-alpine (cryogenic) biome

Mount Cook area, South Island, New Zealand.

The Polar-alpine biome encompasses the extensive Arctic and Antarctic regions as well as high mountainous areas across all continental land masses. Primary productivity is low or very low, strictly seasonal and limited by conditions of extreme cold associated with low insolation and/or high elevation, further exacerbated by desiccating conditions and high-velocity winds. Low temperatures limit metabolic activity and define the length of growing seasons. Microbial decomposition is slow, leading to peat accumulation in the most productive ecosystems. Regional and local temperature gradients shape ecosystems within the biome. Standing biomass, for example, is low or very low and varies with the severity of cold and insolation. Microbial lifeforms dominate in the coldest systems with perennial snow or ice cover, augmented with crustose lichens, bryophytes, and algae on periodically exposed lithic substrates. Forbs, grasses and dwarf shrubs with slow growth rates and long lifespans become increasingly prominent and may develop continuous cover with increasing insolation and warmer conditions. This vegetation cover provides habitat structure and food for vertebrate and invertebrate consumers and their predators. Trophic webs are simple or truncated and populations of larger vertebrates are generally migratory or itinerant. In these warmer cryogenic systems, snow cover is seasonal (except at equatorial latitudes) and insulates plants and animals that lie dormant beneath it during winter and during their emergence from dormancy prior to spring thaw. While dormancy is a common trait, a diverse range of other physiological, behavioural, and morphological traits that facilitate cold tolerance are also well represented among the biota.

# T6.1 Ice sheets, glaciers and perennial snowfields

BIOME: POLAR-ALPINE (CRYOGENIC ECOSYSTEMS)
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

In these icy systems, extreme cold and periodic blizzards limit productivity and diversity to very low levels, and trophic networks are truncated. Wherever surface
or interstitial water is available. life is dominated by micro- organisms, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and algae, which may arrive by Aeolian processes. Bacterial densities vary from 107 to 1011 cells.L-1. On the surface, the main primary producers are snow (mainly Chlamydomonadales) and ice algae (mainly Zygnematales) with contrasting traits. Metabolic activity is generally restricted to summer months at temperatures close to zero and is enabled by exopolymeric substances, cold- adapted enzymes, cold-shock proteins and other physiological traits. N-fixing cyanobacteria are critical in the N-cycle, especially in late summer. Surface heterogeneity and dynamism create cryoconite holes, rich oases for microbial life (especially cyanobacteria, prokaryotic heterotrophs and viruses) and active biogeochemical cycling. Most vertebrates are migratory birds with only the emperor penguin over-wintering on Antarctic
ice. Mass movement and snow burial also places severe constraints on establishment and persistence of life. Snow and ice algae and cyanobacteria on the surface are ecosystem engineers. Their accumulation of organic matter leads to positive feedbacks between melting and microbial activity that discolours snow and reduces albedo. Organic matter produced at the surface can also be transported through the ice to dark subglacial environments, fuelling microbial processes involving heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic prokaryotes and fungi.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Permanent but dynamic ice cover accumulates by periodic snow fall and is reduced
in summer by melting, sublimation, and calving (i.e. blocks of ice breaking free) in the ablation zone. Slow lateral movement occurs downslope or outwards from ice cap centres with associated cracking. Precipitation may average several metres per year on montane glaciers or less than a few hundred millimetres on extensive ice sheets. Surface temperatures are extremely cold in winter (commonly −60°C in Antarctica) but may rise above 0°C in summer. Desiccating conditions occur during high winds or when water is present almost entirely in solid form. Nutrients, especially N and P, are extremely scarce, the main inputs being glacial moraines, aerosols, and seawater (in sea ice), which may be supplemented locally by guano. Below the ice, temperatures are less extreme, there is greater contact between ice, water and rock (enhancing nutrient supply), a diminished light intensity, and redox potential tends towards anoxic conditions, depending on hydraulic residence times.

## DISTRIBUTION

Polar regions and high mountains in the western Americas, central Asia, Europe, and New Zealand, covering ~10% of the earth’s surface.

# T6.2 Polar alpine rocky outcrops

BIOME: POLAR-ALPINE (CRYOGENIC ECOSYSTEMS)
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Low biomass systems with very low productivity constrained by extreme cold, desiccating winds, skeletal substrates, periodic mass movement and, in polar regions, by seasonally low light intensity. The dominant lifeforms are freeze-tolerant crustose lichens, mosses and algae that also tolerate periodic desiccation, invertebrates, such as tardigrades, nematodes and mites, and micro-organisms, including bacteria and protozoa, and nesting birds that forage primarily in other (mostly marine) ecosystems. Diversity and endemism are low, likely due to intense selection pressures and wide dispersal. Trophic networks are simple and truncated. Physiological traits, such as cold-adapted enzymes and cold-shock proteins, enable metabolic activity, which is restricted to summer months when temperatures are close to or above zero. Nutrient input occurs primarily through substrate weathering supplemented by guano, which along with cyanobacteria is a major source of N. Mass movement of snow and rock, with accumulation of snow and ice during the intervals between collapse events, promotes disequilibrium ecosystem dynamics.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Extremely cold winters
with wind-chill that may reduce temperatures below −80°C in Antarctica. In contrast, insolation and heat absorption on rocky substrates may increase summer temperatures well above 0°C. Together with the impermeable substrate and intermittently high winds, exposure to summer insolation may produce periods
of extreme water deficit punctuated by saturated conditions associated with meltwater and seepage. Periodic burial by snow reduces light availability, while mass movement through landslides, avalanches or volcanic eruptions maintain substrate instability and destroy biomass, limiting the persistence of biota.

## DISTRIBUTION

Permanently ice-free areas of Antarctica, Greenland, the Arctic Circle, and high mountains in the western Americas, central Asia, Europe, Africa and New Zealand.

# T6.3 Polar tundra and deserts

BIOME: POLAR-ALPINE (CRYOGENIC ECOSYSTEMS)
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These low productivity autotrophic ecosystems are limited by winter dormancy during deep winter snow cover, extreme cold temperatures and frost during spring thaw, short growing seasons, desiccating winds, and seasonally low light intensity. Microbial decomposition rates are slow, promoting accumulation of peaty permafrost substrates in which only the surface horizon thaws seasonally. Vegetation is treeless and dominated by a largely continuous cover of cold-tolerant bryophytes, lichens, C3 grasses, sedges, forbs and dwarf and prostrate shrubs. Tundra around the world is delimited by the physiological temperature limits of trees, which are excluded where the growing season (i.e. days &gt;0.9°C) is less than 90–94 days duration, with mean temperatures less than 6.5°C across the growing season. In the coldest and/or driest locations, vascular plants are absent and productivity relies on bryophytes, lichens, cyanobacteria and allochthonous energy sources such as guano. Aestivating insects (i.e. those that lay dormant in hot or dry seasons) dominate the invertebrate fauna. Vertebrate fauna is dominated by migratory birds, some of which travel seasonal routes exceeding several thousand kilometres. Many of these feed in distant wetlands or open oceans. These are critical mobile links that transfer nutrients and organic matter and disperse the propagules of other organisms, both externally on plumage or feet and endogenously. A few mammals in the Northern Hemisphere are hibernating residents or migratory herbivores. Pinnipeds occur in near-coast tundras and may
be locally important marine subsidies of nutrients and energy. Predatory canids and polar bears are nomadic or have large home ranges.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Winters are very cold and dark and summers define short, cool growing seasons with long hours of low daylight. Precipitation falls as snow that persists through winter months. In most areas, there is an overall water surplus, occasionally with small summer deficit, but some areas are ice-free, extremely dry (annual precipitation &lt;150 mm p.a.) polar deserts with desiccating winds. Substrates are peaty or gravelly permafrost, which may partially thaw on the surface in summer, causing cryoturbation.

## DISTRIBUTION

Primarily within the Arctic Circle and adjacent subarctic regions, with smaller occurrences on subantarctic islands and the Antarctic coast.

# T6.4 Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands

BIOME: POLAR-ALPINE (CRYOGENIC ECOSYSTEMS)
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Mountain systems beyond the
cold climatic treeline are dominated by grasses, herbs, or low shrubs (typically &lt;1 m tall). Moderate-low and strictly seasonal productivity is limited by deep winter snow cover, extreme
cold and frost during spring thaw, short growing seasons, desiccating winds, and, in some cases, by mass movement. Vegetation comprises a typically continuous cover of plants, including bryophytes, lichens, C3 grasses, sedges, forbs and dwarf shrubs, including cushion growth forms. However, the cover of vascular plants may be much lower in low-rainfall regions or in sites exposed to strong desiccating winds and often characterised by dwarf shrubs and lichens that grow on rocks (i.e. fjaeldmark). Throughout the world, alpine ecosystems are defined by the physiological temperature limits of trees, which are excluded where the growing season (i.e. days &gt;0.9°C) is
less than 90–94 days, with mean temperatures less than 6.5°C across the growing season. Other plants have morphological and ecophysiological traits to protect buds, leaves, and reproductive tissues from extreme cold, including growth forms with many branches, diminutive leaf sizes, sclerophylly, vegetative propagation, and cold-stratification dormancy. The vertebrate fauna includes a few hibernating residents and migratory herbivores and predators that are nomadic or have large home ranges. Aestivating insects include katydids, dipterans, and hemipterans. Local endemism and beta-diversity may be high due to steep elevational gradients, microhabitat heterogeneity and topographic barriers to dispersal between mountain ranges, with evidence of both facilitation and competition.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Winters are long and cold, while summers are short and mild. Seasonal snow up to several metres deep provides insulation to over-wintering plants and animals. Severe frosts and desiccating winds characterise the spring thaw and exposed ridges and slopes. Severe storms may result from orographic-atmospheric instability. Typically there is
a large precipitation surplus, but deficits occur in some regions. Steep elevational gradients and variation in micro-topography and aspect promote microclimatic heterogeneity. Steep slopes are subjected to periodic mass movements, which destroy surface vegetation.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mountains in the temperate and boreal zones of the Americas, Europe, central Eurasia, west and north Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

# T6.5 Tropical alpine grasslands and herbfields

BIOME: POLAR-ALPINE (CRYOGENIC ECOSYSTEMS)
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Treeless mountain systems dominated by an open to dense cover of cold-tolerant C3 perennial tussock grasses, herbs, small shrubs and distinctive arborescent rosette or cushion growth forms. Lichens and bryophytes are also common. Productivity is low, dependent on autochthonous energy, and limited by cold temperatures, diurnal freeze-thaw cycles and desiccating conditions, but
not by a short growing season (as in T6.4). Elfin forms of tropical montane forests (T1.3) occupy sheltered gullies and lower elevations. Diversity is low to moderate but endemism is high among some taxa, reflecting steep elevational gradients, microhabitat heterogeneity, and topographic insularity, which restricts dispersal. Solifluction (i.e. the slow flow of saturated soil downslope) restricts seedling establishment to stable microsites. Plants have traits to protect buds, leaves and reproductive tissues from diurnal cold and transient desiccation stress, including ramulose (i.e. many-branched), cushion and rosette growth forms, insulation from marcescent (i.e. dead) leaves or pectin fluids, diminutive leaf sizes, leaf pubescence, water storage in stem-pith, and vegetative propagation. Most plants are long-lived and some rosette forms are semelparous. Cuticle and epidermal layers reduce UV-B transmission to photosynthetic tissues. Plant coexistence is mediated by competition, facilitation, herbivory (vertebrate and invertebrate) and fire regimes. Simple trophic networks include itinerant large herbivores and predators from adjacent lowland savannas,
as well as resident reptiles, small mammals and macro-invertebrates.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Cold nights (as low as −10°C) and mild days (up to 15°C) produce low mean temperatures and diurnal freeze-thaw cycles, but seasonal temperature range is small and freezing temperatures are short-lived. Cloud cover and precipitation are unseasonal in equatorial latitudes or seasonal
in the monsoonal tropics. Strong orographic effects result in an overall precipitation surplus and snow and fog are common, but desiccating conditions may occur during intervals between precipitation events, with morning insolation also increasing moisture stress when roots are cold. Exposure to UV-B radiation is very high. Substrates are typically rocky and shallow (with low moisture retention capacity) and exposed to solifluction. Micro- topographic heterogeneity influences fine-scale spatial variation in moisture availability. Steep slopes are subjected to periodic mass movements, which destroy surface vegetation. Low- intensity fires may be ignited by lightning or spread upslope from lowland savannas, but these occur infrequently at multi-decadal intervals.

## DISTRIBUTION

Restricted mountainous areas of tropical Central and South America, East and West Africa, and Southeast Asia.
