# FM1 Semi-confined transitional waters biome

The Transitional waters biome includes coastal inlets that
are influenced by inputs of both fresh and marine water from terrestrial catchments and ocean tides, waves and currents. They include deep-water coastal inlets or fjords mostly restricted to high latitudes, as well as estuaries, bays and lagoons, which are scattered around coastlines throughout
the world. Gradients in water regimes, water chemistry, depth, temperature, size and salinity influence the function, productivity, diversity and trophic structure of these transitional ecosystems. The balance between marine or freshwater influences varies seasonally and inter-annually, depending on the climate and among inlets with differing geomorphology, catchment size, climate and exposure to waves and currents. In some cases, ecosystems characteristic of the marine shelf biome (i.e. M1.1 Seagrass meadows) may have significant occurrences within semi-confined transitional waters. Some inlets are permanently connected to the ocean, but others are only intermittently
connected, influencing exchanges of water, nutrients and biota among ecosystems. The dynamics of connection and closure of shallow inlets are regulated by variations in steam flow inputs and wave activity. Strong horizontal and vertical salinity gradients (varying with freshwater and marine inputs) structure biotic communities and traits that equip species for occupying different salinity niches. Autochthonous energy generated by primary production from aquatic macrophytes, phytoplankton, macroalgae and diatoms is subsidised by allochthonous inputs from inlet shorelines, freshwater streams and marine incursion. These high levels of energy availability support complex trophic networks, including large populations of macroinvertebrates, fish, waterbirds, seabirds and some mammals and reptiles. Many inlets function as fish nurseries and bird breeding sites.

# FM1.1 Deepwater coastal inlets

BIOME: FM1 TRANSITIONAL WATERS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Deepwater coastal inlets (e.g.
fjords, sea lochs) are semi-confined aquatic systems with
many features of open oceans. Strong influences from
adjacent freshwater and terrestrial systems produce striking environmental and biotic gradients. Autochthonous energy sources are dominant, but allochthonous sources (e.g. glacial ice discharge, freshwater streams and seasonal permafrost meltwater) may contribute 10% or more of particulate organic matter. Phytoplankton, notably diatoms, contribute most of
the primary production, along with biofilms and macroalgae in the epibenthic layer. Seasonal variation in inflow, temperatures, ice cover and insolation drives pulses of in situ and imported productivity that generate blooms in diatoms, consumed in turn by jellyfish, micronekton, a hierarchy of fish predators and marine mammals. Fish are limited by food, density-dependent predation and cannibalism. As well as driving pelagic trophic networks, seasonal pulses of diatoms shape biogeochemical cycles and the distribution and biomass of benthic biota when they senesce and sink to the bottom, escaping herbivores, which are limited by predators. The vertical flux of diatoms, macrophytes and terrestrial detritus sustains a diversity and abundance of benthic filter-feeders (e.g. maldanids and oweniids). Environmental and biotic heterogeneity underpins functional and compositional contrasts between inlets and strong gradients within them. Zooplankton, fish and jellies distribute in response to resource heterogeneity, environmental cues and interactions with other organisms. Deep inlets sequester more organic carbon into sediments than other estuaries (FM1.2, FM1.3) because steep slopes enable efficient influx of terrestrial carbon and low-oxygen bottom waters abate decay rates. Inlets with warmer water have more complex trophic webs, stronger pelagic-benthic coupling, and utilise a greater fraction of organic carbon, sequestering it in sea-floor sediments at a slower rate than those with cold water.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Deepwater coastal systems may exceed 300 km in length and 2 km in depth. Almost all have glacial origins and many are fed by active glaciers. The ocean interface at the mouth of the inlets, strongly influenced by regional currents, interacts with large seasonal inputs of freshwater to the inner inlet and wind-driven advection, to produce strong and dynamic spatial gradients in nutrients, salinity and organic carbon. Advection is critical to productivity and carrying capacity of the system. Advection drives
water movement in the upper and lower layers of the water column in different directions, linking inlet waters with coastal water masses. Coastal currents also mediate upwelling and downwelling depending on the direction of flow. However, submerged glacial moraines or sills at the inlet mouth may limit marine mixing, which can be limited to seasonal episodes in spring and autumn. Depth gradients in light typically extend beyond the photic zone and are exacerbated at high latitudes by seasonal variation in insolation and surface ice. Vertical fluxes also create strong depth gradients in nutrients, oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, salinity and temperature.

## DISTRIBUTION

Historically or currently glaciated coastlines at polar and cool-temperate latitudes.

# FM1.2 Permanently open riverine estuaries and bays

BIOME: FM1 TRANSITIONAL WATERS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These coastal water bodies are mosaic systems characterised by high spatial and temporal variabilities in structure and function, which depend on coastal geomorphology, ratios of freshwater inflows to marine waters and tidal volume (hence residence time of saline water), and seasonality of climate. Fringing shoreline systems may include intertidal mangroves (MFT1.2), saltmarshes and reedbeds (MFT1.3), rocky (MT1.1), muddy (MT1.2) or sandy shores (MT1.3), while seagrasses and macrophytes (M1.1), shellfish beds (M1.4) or subtidal rocky reefs (M1.6) may occur in shallow intertidal and subtidal areas. Water-column productivity is typically higher than in nearby marine or freshwater systems due to substantial allochthonous energy and nutrient subsidies from shoreline vegetation and riverine and marine sources.
This high productivity supports a complex trophic network
with relatively high mosaic-level diversity and an abundance of aquatic organisms. Planktonic and benthic invertebrates (e.g. molluscs and crustaceans) often sustain large fish populations, with fish nursery grounds being a common feature. Waterbirds (i.e. cormorants), seabirds (i.e. gannets), top-order predatory fish, mammals (e.g. dolphins and dugongs) and reptiles (e.g. marine turtles and crocodilians) exploit these locally abundant food sources. Many of these organisms in upper trophic
levels are highly mobile and move among different estuaries through connected ocean waters or by flying. Others migrate between different ecosystem types to complete their various life-history phases, although some may remain resident for long periods. Most biota tolerate a broad range of salinity or are spatially structured by gradients. The complex spatial mixes
of physical and chemical characteristics, alongside seasonal, inter-annual, and sporadic variability in aquatic conditions, induce correspondingly large spatial-temporal variability in food webs. Low-salinity plumes, usually proportional to river size and discharge, may extend far from the shore, producing tongues of ecologically distinct conditions into the marine environment.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Characteristics of these coastal systems are governed by the relative dominance of saline marine waters versus freshwater inflows (groundwater and riverine), the latter depending on the seasonality of precipitation and evaporative stress. Geomorphology ranges from wave- dominated estuaries to drowned river valleys, tiny inlets and enormous bays. These forms determine the residence time, proportion, and distribution of saline waters, which in turn affect salinity and thermal gradients and stratification, dissolved O2 concentration, nutrients, and turbidity. The water column is closely linked to mudflats and sandflats, in which an array of biogeochemical processes occurs, including denitrification and N-fixation, and nutrient cycling.

## DISTRIBUTION

Coastlines of most landmasses but rarely on arid or polar coasts.

# FM1.3 Intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons

BIOME: FM1 TRANSITIONAL WATERS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL FRESHWATER-MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These coastal water bodies
have high spatial and temporal variability in structure and function, which depends largely on the status of the lagoonal entrance (open or closed). Communities have low species richness compared to those of permanently open estuaries (FM1.2). Lagoonal entrance closure prevents the entry of
marine organisms and resident biota must tolerate significant variation in salinity, inundation, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations. Resident communities are dominated by opportunists with short lifecycles. Trophic networks are generally detritus-based, fuelled by substantial inputs of organic matter from the terrestrial environment and, to a lesser extent, from the sea. As net sinks of organic matter from the land, productivity is often high, and lagoons may serve as nursery habitats for fish. High concentrations of polyphenolic compounds (i.e. tannins) in the water and periods of low nutrient input limit phytoplankton populations. Benthic communities dominate with attached algae, microphytobenthos and micro- and macro-fauna being the dominant groups. The water column supports plankton
and small-bodied fish. Emergent and fringing vegetation is key source of detrital carbon to the food webs, and also provides important structural habitats. Saltmarsh and reedbeds (MFT1.3) can adjoin lagoons while seagrasses (M1.1) occupy sandy bottoms of some lagoons, but mangroves (MFT1.2) are absent unless the waters are warm and the entrance opens frequently.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These are shallow coastal water bodies that are intermittently connected with the ocean. Some lagoons are mostly open, closing only once every few decades. Some open and close frequently, and some are closed most of the time. The timing and frequency of entrance opening depend on the balance between onshore and offshore sedimentation processes (which close the entrance) and flushes of catchment inflow or erosive wave action (which open the entrance). Opening leads to changes in water level, tidal amplitude, salinity gradients, temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen and sources of organic carbon. Human-regulated opening influences many of these processes.

## DISTRIBUTION

Wave-dominated coastlines worldwide,
but prevalent along microtidal to low mesotidal mid-latitude coastlines with high inter-annual variability in rainfall and wave climate. Most prevalent in Australia (21% of global occurrences), South Africa (16%) and Mexico (16%).
