# SF2 地下人造淡水生物群系

地下人造淡水生物群系包括由人類建造的地下運河、排水管、下水道、供水管道和淹沒的礦井等水域。 此生物群系通常與地表水連接， 資源可用性取決於水源及其水文狀況，兼具永久性到間歇性水域，且流速快慢不等，在淹沒的礦井中流速可能非常慢。 此生物群系缺乏光照，來自通風口和管道入口的光線通常過於微弱，無法進行光合作用。
然而，根據水源狀況，藻類可能會隨水流進入此生物群系。 儘管初級生產力較低且仰賴異源能量，在下水道和排水管中，由於有機碳、養分和溶氧充足，異營微生物在生物膜和水柱中提供的次級生產力可能會很高， 得以供應多階層的碎食者和掠食者，包括微型無脊椎動物、大型無脊椎動物，以及小型脊椎動物，如囓齒類和魚類。 由於通氣不良或微生物活動旺盛，當有機碳和養分充足但溶氧稀少時，厭氧菌可能是食物網中的重要成員。 在供水管道中，有機碳和養分含量低，加劇缺乏日照對初級生產力的負面影響。 管道內的食物網較為簡化，大多數生物來自連通的水源，僅暫時棲息於管道中。

# SF2.1 水管及地下運河

生物群系：SF2 地下人造淡水生物群系
生態域：地下域與淡水域過渡帶

## 生態特徵

人工建造的水管及地下運河缺乏日照且低生產力，是人工或天然淡水生態系之間水分、養分和生物相的通道。 仰賴地表生態系提供的異源能量。 儘管與地下溪流（S2.1）相似，此生態系的結構更為簡單、歷史較短、生物多樣性較低、演化譜系較少且無特有種。 生物多是偶然在生態系間流動，物種多樣性和豐度較低。 食物網結構簡化，完全或幾乎沒有初級生產者，且除了偶爾出現的暫時性物種外，沒有脊椎動物掠食者。 The majority of the resident heterotrophic biota are bacteria, aquatic fungi and protists living in biofilms covering mostly smooth artificial surfaces or cut rock faces. Biofilms constitute food sources for detritivores and predators, including protozoans and planktonic invertebrates, as well as filter feeders such
as molluscs. The structure of the biofilm community varies considerably with hydraulic regime, as does the biota in the water column. Transient vertebrates, notably fish, occupy well-connected ecosystems with abundant food and predominantly depend on transported nutrients and prey. A range of organisms may survive in these environments but only some maintain reproductive populations. All biota are capable of surviving under no or low light conditions, at least temporarily while in transit. Other traits vary with hydraulic regimes and hydrochemistry, with physiological tolerance to toxins important in highly eutrophic, slow-flowing drains and tolerance to low nutrients and turbulence typical in high-velocity minerotrophic water pipes.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Subterranean canals and water pipes are engineered structures designed to connect
and move waters between artificial (or more rarely natural) sources. They are united by an absence of light and usually low oxygen levels and low variability in temperatures, but hydraulic regimes, nutrient levels, water chemistry, flow and turbulence vary greatly among ecosystems. Water supply pipes are extreme oligotrophic systems with rapid flow, high turbulence, low nutrients and low connectivity to the atmosphere, often sourced from de-oxygenated water at depth within large reservoirs (F3.1). In contrast, subterranean wastewater or stormwater canals
have slower, more intermittent flows, low turbulence and very high nutrient levels and chemical pollutants, including toxins. Many of these eutrophic systems have an in situ atmosphere, but dissolved oxygen levels are very low in connection with high levels of dissolved organic Carbon and microbial activity.

## DISTRIBUTION

Common in landscapes with urban or industrial infrastructure, including water supply and sewerage reticulation systems, hydroelectricity, irrigation and other intensive agricultural industries.

# SF2.2 Flooded mines and other voids BIOME: SF2 FRESHWATER SUBTERRANEAN SYSTEMS

REALM: TRANSITIONAL SUBTERRANEAN-FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Abandoned and now flooded underground mines frequently contain extensive reservoirs of geothermally warmed groundwater, colonized by stygobitic invertebrates from nearby natural subterranean habitats. A fraction of the biota is likely to have been introduced by mining activities. A lack of light excludes photoautotrophs from these systems and low connectivity limits inputs from allochthonous energy sources. Consequently, overall productivity is low, and is likely to depend on chemoautrophic microbes (i.e. sulfate-reducing bacteria) as sources of energy. Few studies have investigated the ecology of the aquatic biota in quasi-stagnant water within mine workings, but trophic networks are truncated and likely to be simple, with low diversity and abundance
at all trophic levels, and no endemism. Most of the resident heterotrophic biota are bacteria, aquatic fungi and protists living in biofilms on artificial surfaces of abandoned infrastructure, equipment or cut rock faces. Extremophiles are likely to dominate in waters that are highly acidic or with high concentrations of heavy metals or other toxins. Micro-invertebrates are most likely to be the highest-level predators. Some voids may have simple assemblages of macroinverterbates, but few are likely to support vertebrates unless they are connected with surface waters that provide a means of colonization.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Like all subterranean ecosystems, light is absent or extremely dim in flooded mines. Unlike subterranean canals and pipes (SF2.1), mine waters are quasi-stagnant and not well connected to surface waters. During mine operation, water is pumped out of the mine forming a widespread cone of water table depression, with oxidation and hydrolysis of exposed minerals changing groundwater chemistry. When mines close and dewatering ceases, water table rebounds and the voids often flood. Some voids are completely inundated, while others retain a subterranean atmosphere, which may or may not be connected to the surface. Further changes in water chemistry occur after flooding due to dissolution and flushing of the oxidation products. Water is often warm due to geothermal heating. After inundation has stabilised, seepage and mixing may be slow, and stratification creates strong gradients in oxygen and solutes. Waters are acidic in most flooded mines. The ionic composition varies depending on mineralogy of the substrate, but ionic concentrations are typically high, and often contain heavy metals at levels toxic to some aquatic biota. Acid mine drainage is a common cause of pollution in surface rivers and streams, where it seeps to the surface.

## DISTRIBUTION

Common in in many mineral rich regions of the world.
