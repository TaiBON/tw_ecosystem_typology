# T3 Shrublands and shrubby woodlands biome

The Shrublands and shrub-dominated woodlands biome includes oligotrophic systems occurring on acidic, sandy soils that are often shallow or skeletal. Classically regarded as ‘azonal’ biomes or ‘pedobiomes’ (i.e. biomes determined by soils), they are scattered across all landmasses outside the polar regions, generally (but not always) closer to continental margins than to interior regions and absent from central Asia. Productivity and biomass are low to moderate and limited
by soil fertility. The effect of nutrient poverty on productivity
is exacerbated in tropical to mid-latitudes by water deficits occurring during either winter (tropics) or summer (temperate humid and Mediterranean climates) and by low insolation and cold temperatures at higher latitudes. Trophic networks are simple but the major functional components (photoautotrophic plants, decomposers, detritivores, herbivores and predators) are all represented and fuelled by autochthonous energy sources. Shrubs are the dominant primary producers and possess a
diversity of leaf and root traits as well as mutualistic relationships with soil microbes that promote the capture and conservation of nutrients. Recurrent disturbance events exert top-down regulation by consuming biomass, releasing resources, and triggering life-history processes (including recruitment and dispersal) in a range of organisms. Fire is the most widespread mechanism, with storms or mass movement of substrate less frequently implicated. Storage effects related to re-sprouting organs and seed banks appear to be important for maintaining plant diversity and hence structure and function in shrublands exposed to recurring fires and water deficits.

# T3.1 Seasonally dry tropical shrublands

BIOME: T3 SHRUBLANDS & SHRUBBY WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These moderate-productivity, mostly evergreen shrublands, shrubby grasslands and low, open forests (generally &lt;6 m tall) are limited by nutritional poverty
and strong seasonal drought in the tropical winter months. Taxonomic and functional diversity is moderate in most groups but with high local endemism in plants, invertebrates, birds and other taxa. Vegetation is spatially heterogeneous in a matrix of savannas (T4.2) or tropical dry forests (T1.2) and dominated
by sclerophyllous shrubs with small leaf sizes (nanophyll- microphyll) and low SLA. C4 grasses may be conspicuous or co-dominant (unlike in most temperate heathlands, T3.2) but generally do not form a continuous stratum as in savannas
(T4). These systems have relatively simple trophic networks fuelled by autochthonous energy sources. Productivity is low to moderate and constrained by seasonal drought and nutritional poverty. Shrubs are the dominant primary producers and show traits promoting the capture and conservation of nutrients (e.g. sclerophylly, cluster roots, carnivorous structures, and microbial and fungal root mutualisms) and tolerance to severe seasonal droughts (i.e. stomatal invagination). Nectarivorous and/or insectivorous birds and reptiles and granivorous small mammals dominate the vertebrate fauna, but vertebrate herbivores are sparse. Recurring fires play a role in the top-down regulation of ecosystem structure and composition.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

A severe seasonal climatic water deficit during tropical winter months is exacerbated by sandy or shallow rocky substrates with low moisture retention. Nutritional poverty (especially N and P) stems from oligotrophic, typically acid substrates, such as sandstones, ironstones, leached sand deposits, or rocky volcanic or ultramafic substrates. Vegetation holds the largest pool of nutrients. Temperatures are warm, rarely &lt;10°C, with low diurnal and seasonal variation. Dry-season fires recur on decadal or longer time scales, but they are rare in table-top mountains (tepui).

## DISTRIBUTION

Brazilian campos rupestres (where grasses are important), Venezuelan tepui, Peruvian tabletops, Florida sands, northern Australia and montane oceanic islands.

# T3.2 Seasonally dry temperate heaths and shrublands

BIOME: T3 SHRUBLANDS & SHRUBBY WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Sclerophyllous, evergreen shrublands are distinctive ecosystems of humid and subhumid climates in mid-latitudes. Their low-moderate productivity is fuelled by autochthonous energy sources and is limited by resource constraints and/or recurring disturbance. Vegetation
is dominated by shrubs with very low SLA, high C:N ratios, shade-intolerance, and long-lived, small, often ericoid leaves, with or without a low, open canopy of sclerophyll trees. The ground layer may include geophytes and sclerophyll graminoids, although less commonly true grasses. Trophic webs are simple, with large mammalian predators scarce or absent, and low densities of vertebrate herbivores. Native browsers may have local effects on vegetation. Diversity and local endemism may
be high among vascular plants and invertebrate consumers. Plants and animals have morphological, ecophysiological,
and life-history traits that promote persistence under summer droughts, nutrient poverty, and recurring fires, which play a role in top-down regulation. Stomatal regulation and root architecture promote drought tolerance in plants. Cluster roots and acid exudates, mycorrhizae and insectivory promote nutrient capture, while cellulose, lignin, exudate production and leaf longevity promote nutrient conservation in plants. Vertebrate herbivores and granivores possess specialised dietary and digestive traits enabling consumption of foliage with low nutrient content and secondary compounds. Decomposition rates are slow, allowing litter-fuel accumulation to add to well-aerated fine fuels in shrub canopies. Life-history traits, such as recovery organs, serotiny, post-fire seedling recruitment, pyrogenic flowering and fire- related germination cues, promote plant survival, growth and reproduction under recurring canopy fires. Animals evade fires
in burrows or through mobility. Animal pollination syndromes
are common (notably dipterans, lepidopterans, birds, and sometimes mammals) and ants may be prominent in seed dispersal.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

A marked summer water deficit and a modest winter surplus is driven by high summer temperatures and evapotranspiration with winter-maximum or aseasonal rainfall patterns. Winters are mild, or cool at high elevations. Sandy soil textures or reverse-texture effects of clay- loams exacerbate an overall water deficit. Soils are typically acid, derived from siliceous sand deposits, sandstones, or
acid intrusives or volcanics, and are low to very low in P, N and mineral cations (though this varies between regions, e.g, base- rich limestones, marl and dolomites in southern Europe). The climate, soils and vegetation promote summer canopy fires at decadal to multi-decadal intervals. Positive feedbacks between fire and vegetation may be important in maintaining flammability.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mediterranean-type climate regions
of Europe, north and south Africa, southern Australia, western North and South America, and occurrences in non- Mediterranean climates in eastern Australia, the USA, and Argentina.

# T3.3 Cool temperate heathlands

BIOME: T3 SHRUBLANDS & SHRUBBY WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These mixed graminoid shrublands are restricted to cool-temperate maritime environments. Typically, the vegetation cover is &gt;70% and mostly less than
1 m tall, dominated by low, semi-sclerophyllous shrubs with ferns and C3 graminoids. Shrub foliage is mostly evergreen
and ericoid, with low SLA or reduced to spiny stems. Modular growth forms are common among shrubs and grasses. Diversity and local endemism are low across taxa and the trophic network is relatively simple. Primary productivity is low, based on autochthonous energy sources and limited by cold temperatures and low-fertility acid soils rather than by water deficit (as in other heathlands, T3). Seasonally low light may limit productivity at the highest latitudes. Cool temperatures and low soil oxygen due to periodically wet subsoil limit decomposition by microbes and fungi so that soils accumulate organic matter despite low productivity. Mammalian browsers including cervids, lagomorphs and camelids (South America) consume local plant biomass but subsidise autochthonous energy with carbon and nutrients consumed in more productive forest or anthropogenic ecosystems adjacent to the heathlands. Browsers and
recurring low-intensity fires appear to be important in top-down regulatory processes that prevent the transition to forest, as
is anthropogenic fire, grazing, and tree removal. Canids and raptors are the main vertebrate predators. Other characteristic vertebrate fauna include ground-nesting birds and rodents.
At least some communities exhibit autogenic cyclical patch dynamics in which shrubs and grasses are alternately dominant, senescent and regenerating.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Unlike most other heathlands, these ecosystems have an overall water surplus, although sometimes with small summer deficits. Mild summers and cold winters with periodic snow are tempered by maritime climatic influences. A short day length and low solar angle limits energy influx at the highest latitudes. Severe coastal storms with high winds occur periodically. Acid soils, typically with high humic content in upper horizons, are often limited in N and P. Low-intensity fires recur at decadal time scales or rarely. Some northern European heaths were derived from forest and return to forest when burning and grazing ceases.

## DISTRIBUTION

Boreal and cool temperate coasts of western Europe and America, the Azores and the Magellanic region of South America, mostly at &gt;40° latitude, except where transitional with warm-temperate heaths (e.g. France and Spain).

# T3.4 Rocky pavements, lava flows and screes

BIOME: T3 SHRUBLANDS & SHRUBBY WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Vegetation dominated by cryptogams (lichens, bryophytes), with scattered shrubs- with very low LAI develops on skeletal rocky substrates. These low-productivity systems are limited by moisture and nutrient scarcity, temperature extremes, and periodic disturbance through mass movement. Diversity and endemism is low
across taxa and the trophic structure is simple. Reptiles and ground-nesting birds are among the few resident vertebrates. Lichens and bryophytes may be abundant and perform
critical roles in moisture retention, nutrient acquisition, energy capture, surface stabilisation and proto-soil development, especially through carbon accumulation. N-fixing lichens and cyanobacteria, nurse plants and other mutualisms are critical
to ecosystem development. Rates of ecosystem development are linked to substrate weathering, decomposition and soil development, which mediate nutrient supply, moisture retention and temperature amelioration. Vascular plants have nanophyll- microphyll leaves and low SLA. Their cover is sparse and comprises ruderal pioneer species (shrubs, grasses and forbs) that colonise exposed surfaces and extract moisture from rock crevices. Species composition and vegetation structure are dynamic in response to surface instability and show limited differentiation across environmental gradients and microsites due to successional development, episodes of desiccation and periodic disturbances that destroy biomass. Rates of vegetation development, soil accumulation and compositional change display amplified temperature-dependence due to resource- concentration effects. Older rocky systems have greater micro- habitat diversity, more insular biota and higher endemism, and are classified in other functional groups.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Skeletal substrates (e.g. lava pavements, scree slopes and rock outcrops) limit water retention and nutrient capital and increase heat absorption, leading to periodically extreme temperatures. High summer temperatures and solar exposure concentrate resources and increase the temperature-sensitivity of biogeochemical processes. Winter temperatures may be cold at high elevations (see T6.2). Recurring geophysical disturbances, such as lava flow, mass movement and geothermal activity, as well as desiccation episodes, periodically destroy biomass and reset successional pathways.

## DISTRIBUTION

Localised areas scattered around the Pacific Rim, African Rift Valley, Mediterranean and north Atlantic.
