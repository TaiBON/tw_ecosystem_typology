# T1 Tropical-subtropical forests biome

The Tropical-subtropical forests biome includes moderate to highly productive ecosystems with closed tree canopies occurring at lower latitudes north and south of the equator. Fragmented occurrences extend to the subtropics in suitable mesoclimates. High primary productivity is underpinned by high insolation, warm temperatures, relatively low seasonal variation in day length and temperature (increasing to the subtropics), and strong water surpluses associated with the intertropical convergence zone extending to wetter parts of the seasonal tropics and subtropics. Productivity and biomass vary in response to: i) strong rainfall gradients associated with seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone; ii) altitudinal gradients in precipitation, cloud cover, and temperatures; and iii) edaphic gradients that influence the availability of soil nutrients. Species diversity and the complexity of both vegetation and trophic structures are positively correlated with standing biomass and primary productivity; however, trophic webs and other ecosystem processes are strongly regulated from the bottom-up by the dominant photoautotrophs (trees), which fix abundant energy and carbon, engineer habitats for many other organisms, and underpin feedbacks related to nutrient and water cycling and regional climate. Complex nutrient cycling and/or sequestering mechanisms are common, countering the high potential for soil nutrient leaching due to high rainfall. Plant species exhibit leaf plasticity, shade tolerance and gap-phase dynamics in response to the periodic opening of canopy gaps initiated by tree death, storm damage, and lightning strikes. Fires may occur in ecotonal areas between these forests and savannas. Biogeographic legacies result in strong compositional distinctions and consequently some functional differences among land masses within the biome.

# T1.1 Tropical subtropical lowland rainforests

REALM: TERRESTRIAL

Contributors: D.A. Keith, K.R. Young, R.T. Corlett

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These closed-canopy forests
are renowned for their complex structure and high primary productivity, which support high functional and taxonomic diversity. At subtropical latitudes they transition to warm temperate forests (T2.4). Bottom-up regulatory processes are fuelled by large autochthonous energy sources that support very high primary productivity, biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI). The structurally complex, multi-layered, evergreen tree canopy has a large range of leaf sizes (typically macrophyll- notophyll) and high SLA, reflecting rapid growth and turnover. Diverse plant life forms include buttressed trees, bamboos (sometimes abundant), epiphytes, lianas and ferns, but
grasses and hydrophytes are absent or rare. Trophic networks are complex and vertically stratified with low exclusivity
and diverse representation of herbivorous, frugivorous and carnivorous vertebrates. Tree canopies support a vast diversity of invertebrate herbivores and their predators. Mammals and birds play critical roles in plant diaspore dispersal and pollination. Growth and reproductive phenology may be seasonal or unseasonal, and reproductive masting is common in trees and regulates diaspore predation. Fungal, microbial and diverse invertebrate decomposers and detritivores dominate the forest floor and the subsoil. Diversity is high across taxa, especially
at the upper taxonomic levels of trees, vertebrates, fungi and invertebrate fauna. Neutral processes as well as micro-niche partitioning may have a role in sustaining high diversity, but evidence is limited. Many plants are in the shade, forming seedling banks that exploit gap-phase dynamics initiated by individual tree-fall or stand-level canopy disruption by tropical storms in near coastal forests. Seed banks regulated by dormancy are uncommon. Many trees exhibit leaf form plasticity enabling photosynthetic function in deep shade, dappled light or full sun, even on a single individual. Some species germinate on tree trunks, gaining quicker access to canopy light, while roots absorb microclimatic moisture until they reach the soil.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration with low intra- and inter-annual variability, creating a reliable year-round surplus, while closed tree canopies maintain humid microclimate and shade. Temperatures are warm with low-moderate diurnal and seasonal variation (mean winter minima rarely &lt;10°C except in subtropical transitional zones). Soils are moist but not regularly inundated or peaty (see TF1.3) Most nutrient capital is sequestered in vegetation or cycled through the dynamic litter layer, critical for retaining nutrients that would otherwise be leached or lost to runoff.
In some coastal regions outside equatorial latitudes (mostly &gt;10° and excluding extensive forests in continental America and Africa), decadal regimes of tropical storms drive cycles of canopy destruction and renewal.

## DISTRIBUTION

Humid tropical and subtropical regions in Central and West Africa, Southeast Asia, Oceania, northeast Australia, Central and tropical South America and the Caribbean.

# T1.2 Tropical subtropical dry forests and thickets

BIOME: TROPICAL-SUBTROPICAL
FORESTS REALM: TERRESTRIAL

Contributors: R.T. Pennington, J. Franklin, N.A. Brummitt, A. Etter, K.R. Young, R.T. Corlett, D.A. Keith

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These closed-canopy forests and thickets have drought-deciduous or semi-deciduous phenology in at least some woody plants (rarely fully evergreen), and
thus seasonally high LAI. Strongly seasonal photoautotrophic productivity is limited by a regular annual water deficit/surplus cycle. Diversity is lower across most taxa than T1.1, but tree and vertebrate diversity is high relative to most other forest systems. Plant growth forms and leaf sizes are less diverse
than in T1.1. Grasses are rare or absent, except on savanna ecotones, due to canopy shading and/or water competition, while epiphytes, ferns, bryophytes and forbs are present but limited by seasonal drought. Trophic networks are complex
with low exclusivity and diverse representation of herbivorous, frugivorous, and carnivorous vertebrates. Fungi and other microbes are important decomposers of abundant leaf litter. Many woody plants are dispersed by wind and some by vertebrates. Most nutrient capital is sequestered in vegetation or cycled through the litter layer. Trees typically have thin bark and low fire tolerance and can recruit in shaded microsites. Plants are tolerant of seasonal drought but can exploit moisture when it is seasonally available through high SLA and plastic productivity. Gap-phase dynamics are driven primarily by individual tree-fall and exploited by seedling banks and vines (seedbanks are uncommon). These forests may be involved in fire-regulated stable-state dynamics with savannas.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Overall water surplus (or small deficit &lt;100 mm), but a substantial seasonal deficit
in winter in which little or no rain falls within a 4–7-month period. Warm temperatures (minima rarely &lt;10°C) with low- moderate diurnal and seasonal variability in the tropics, but greater seasonal variability in subtropical continental areas. Diverse substrates generally produce high levels of nutrients. Tropical storms may be important disturbances in some areas but flammability is low due to limited ground fuels except on savanna ecotones.

## DISTRIBUTION

Seasonally dry tropical and subtropical regions in Central and West Africa, Madagascar, southern Asia, north and northern and eastern Australia, the Pacific, Central and South America and the Caribbean.

# T1.3 Tropical-subtropical montane rainforests

BIOME: TROPICAL-SUBTROPICAL FORESTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Closed-canopy evergreen forests on tropical mountains usually have a single-layer low tree canopy (~5–20 m tall) with small leaf sizes (microphyll-notophyll) and high SLA. They transition to lowland rainforests (T1.1) with decreasing altitude and to warm temperate forests (T2.4)
at subtropical latitudes. Structure and taxonomic diversity become more diminutive and simpler with altitude, culminating in elfinwood forms. Conspicuous epiphytic ferns, bryophytes, lichens, orchids and bromeliads drape tree branches and exploit atmospheric moisture (cloud stripping), but grasses are rare or absent, except for bamboos in some areas. Moderate productivity is fuelled by autochthonous energy, limited by cool temperatures, possibly by high exposure to UV-B radiation, and sometimes by shallow soil and/or wind exposure. Growth and reproductive phenology is usually seasonal. Plant propagules are dispersed mostly by wind and territorial birds and mammals. Taxonomic diversity is moderate to low, especially in the tree canopy, but there is often high local endemism at higher altitudes in most groups, especially amphibians, birds, plants and invertebrates. Gap-phase dynamics are driven by individual tree-fall or lightning strikes, more rarely by extreme wind storms in some areas. Seedling banks are common (seedbanks are uncommon) and most plants are shade tolerant and can recruit in the shade.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Substantial cloud moisture and high humidity underpin a reliable year-round rainfall surplus over evapotranspiration. Altitudinal gradients in temperature, precipitation and exposure are pivotal in ecosystem structure and function. Frequent cloud cover from orographic uplift
and closed tree canopies maintain a moist microclimate and shady conditions. Temperatures are mild-cool with occasional frost. Seasonal variability is low-moderate but diurnal variability is moderate-high. Winter monthly mean minima may be around 0°C in some areas. Landslides are a significant
form of disturbance that drive successional dynamics on steep slopes and is exacerbated by extreme rainfall events.
Mountains experience elevated UV-B radiation with altitude and, in some regions, are exposed to local or regional storms.

## DISTRIBUTION

Humid tropical and subtropical regions in East Africa, East Madagascar, Southeast Asia, west Oceania, northeast Australia, Central and tropical South America.

# T1.4 Tropical heath forests

BIOME: TROPICAL-SUBTROPICAL FORESTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Structurally simple evergreen
forests with closed to open canopies, typically 5–20 m tall
and uniform with a moderate to high LAI. Productivity is lower than in other tropical forests, weakly seasonal and limited
by nutrient availability and in some cases by soil anoxia, but decomposition rates are high. Plant traits, such as insectivory and N-fixing microbial associations, are well represented, suggesting adaptive responses to nitrogen deficiency. Aside from plant insectivory, trophic networks are simple compared
to other tropical forests. Diversity of plant and animal taxa is
also relatively low, but endemism is proportionately high. Tree foliage is characterised by small (microphyll-notophyll) leaves with lower SLA than other tropical forests. Leaves are leathery and often ascending vertically, enabling more light penetration to ground level than in other tropical forests. Tree stems are slender (generally &lt;20 cm in diameter), sometimes twisted, and often densely packed and without buttresses. Epiphytes are usually abundant but lianas are rare and ground vegetation is sparse, with the forest floor dominated by insectivorous vascular plants and bryophytes.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These forests experience
an overall water surplus, but productivity is limited by deep sandy low-nutrient acidic substrates, which are leached by high rainfall. Most nutrients are retained in the vegetation. Downward movement of clay and organic particles through the soil profile results in a deep, white sandy horizon capped by a thin grey surface horizon (typical of podzols), limiting the capacity of the soil to retain nutrients (especially nitrogen) and moisture within the shallow rooting zone. Hence they are prone to inter-annual droughts, but waterlogging may occur where the water table
is close to the surface, resulting in periodic anoxia within the root zone. Landscape water-table gradients result in surface mosaics in which heath forests may be juxtaposed with more waterlogged peat forests (TF1.1) and palustrine wetland systems (TF1.4).

## DISTRIBUTION

Scattered through northwest and west Amazonia, possibly Guyana, and Southeast Asia, notably in the Rio Negro catchment and southern Kalimantan. Not known in Africa, but possibly in the Congo region.

# T2 Temperate-boreal forests and woodlands biome

Temperate-boreal forests and woodlands biome include moderate to highly productive tree-dominated systems with
a wide range of physiognomic and structural expressions distributed from warm-temperate to boreal latitudes. Although generally less diverse than Tropical-subtropical forests (T1)
in taxa such as flowering plants, primates, and birds, these Temperate-boreal forests exhibit greater temporal and spatial variability in productivity, biomass, phenology, and leaf traits
of trees. Temporal variability is expressed primarily through seasonal variation in water balance and/or temperature, which regulate the length and timing of growing and breeding seasons. Inter-annual variation is usually less important than in some other biomes (i.e. T5), but nonetheless may play significant roles in resource availability and disturbance regimes (e.g. fire and storms). Gradients in minimum temperatures, soil nutrients, and fire regimes differentiate ecosystem functional groups within this biome. These influence traits such as leaf form (broadleaf
vs. needleleaf), leaf phenology (evergreen vs. deciduous), ecophysiological and morphological traits promoting nutrient acquisition and conservation, and morphological traits related to flammability, fire resistance, and recovery. The dominant photoautotrophs (trees) engineer habitats and underpin trophic webs. Resource gradients exert strong bottom-up controls
on trophic processes, but in some temperate forests, fires are significant top-down consumers of biomass, as well as influencing flammability feedbacks and timing of life-history processes, such as reproduction and recruitment.

# T2.1 Boreal and temperate montane forests and woodlands

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Evergreen, structurally simple forests and woodlands in cold climates are dominated by needle-
leaf conifers and may include a subdominant component of deciduous trees, especially in disturbed sites, accounting for
up to two-thirds of stand-level leaf biomass. Boreal forests are generally less diverse, more cold-tolerant and support a more migratory fauna than temperate montane forests. Structure varies from dense forest up to 30 m tall to stunted open woodlands &lt;5 m tall. Large trees engineer habitats of many fungi, non-vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrates that depend on rugose bark, coarse woody debris, or large tree canopies. Energy is mainly from autochthonous sources, but may include allochthonous subsidies from migratory vertebrates. Primary productivity is limited by seasonal cold and may also
be limited by water deficit on coarse textured soils. Forested bogs occupy peaty soils (TF1.6). Seasonal primary productivity may sustain a trophic web with high densities of small and large herbivores (e.g. hare, bear, deer and insects), with feline, canine and raptor predators. Browsers are top-down regulators of plant biomass and cyclers of nitrogen, carbon and nutrients. Forest structure may be disrupted by insect defoliation or fires on multi- decadal cycles. Tree recruitment occurs semi-continuously in gaps or episodically following canopy fires and may be limited
by spring frost, desiccation, permafrost fluctuations, herbivory and surface fires. Plants and animals have strongly seasonal growth and reproductive phenology, and possess morphological, behavioural and ecophysiological traits enabling cold-tolerance and the exploitation of short growing seasons. Plant traits include bud protection, extra-cellular freezing tolerance, hardened evergreen needle leaves with low SLA or deciduous leaves with high SLA, cold-stratification seed dormancy, seasonal geophytic growth forms and vegetative storage
organs. Tracheids in conifers confer resistance to cavitation in drought by compartmentalising water transport tissues. Some large herbivores and most birds migrate to winter habitats from the boreal zone, and thus function as mobile links, dispersing other biota and bringing allochthonous subsidies of energy
and nutrients into the system. Hibernation is common among sedentary vertebrates, while insect life cycles have adult phases cued to spring emergence.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These systems are driven by large seasonal temperature ranges, cold winters with prolonged winter snow, low light, short growing seasons (1–3 months averaging &gt;10°C) and severe post-thaw frosts. There is an overall water surplus, but annual precipitation can be &lt;200 mm. Soil moisture recharged by winter snow sustains the system through evapotranspiration peaks in summer, but moisture can be limiting where these systems extend to mountains in warm semi-arid latitudes. The acid soils usually accumulate peat and upper horizons may be frozen in winter. Forests may be prone to lightning-induced canopy fires on century time scales and surface fires on multi-decadal scales.

## DISTRIBUTION

Boreal distribution across Eurasia and North America, extending to temperate (rarely subtropical) latitudes on mountains.

# T2.2 Deciduous temperate forests

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These structurally simple, winter deciduous forests have high productivity and LAI in summer. Winter dormancy, hibernation and migration are common life histories among plants and animals enabling cold avoidance. Local endemism is comparatively low and there are modest levels of diversity across major taxa. The forest canopy comprises at least two-thirds deciduous broad-leaf foliage (notophylll-mesophyll) with high Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and up to one-third evergreen (typically needleleaf) cover. As well as deciduous woody forms, annual turnover of above-ground biomass also occurs some in non-woody geophytic and other ground flora, which are insulated from the cold beneath winter snow and flower soon after snowmelt before tree canopy closure. Annual leaf turnover is sustained by fertile substrates and water surplus, with nutrient withdrawal from foliage and storage of starch prior to fall. Tissues are protected from cold by supercooling rather than extra-cellular freeze-tolerance. Dormant buds are insulated from frost by bracts or by burial below the soil in some non-woody plants. Fungal and microbial decomposers play vital roles in cycling carbon and nutrients
in the soil surface horizon. Despite highly seasonal primary productivity, the trophic network includes large browsing herbivores (deer), smaller granivores and herbivores (rodents and hares) and mammalian predators (canids and felines). Most invertebrates are seasonally active. Behavioural and life-history traits allow animals to persist through cold winters, including through dense winter fur, food caching, winter foraging, hibernation, dormant life phases and migration. Migratory animals provide allochthonous subsidies of energy and nutrients and promote incidental dispersal of other biota. Browsing mammals and insects are major consumers of plant biomass and cyclers of nitrogen, carbon and nutrients. Deciduous trees may be early colonisers of disturbed areas (later replaced
by evergreens), but are also stable occupants across large temperate regions. Tree recruitment is limited by spring frost, allelopathy and herbivory, and occurs semi-continuously in gaps. Herbivores may influence densities of deciduous forest canopies by regulating tree regeneration. Deciduous leaf fall may exert allelopathic control over tree seedlings and seasonal ground flora.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Phenological processes in these forests are driven by large seasonal temperature ranges (mean winter temperatures &lt;-1°C, summer means up to 22°C), typically with substantial winter snow and limited growing season, with 4–6 months &gt;10°C, and severe post-thaw frosts. Fertile soils with high N levels and an overall water surplus support deciduous leaf turnover. Fires are uncommon.

## DISTRIBUTION

Cool temperate Europe (southwest Russia to British Isles), northeast Asia (northeast China, southern Siberia Korea, and Japan), and northeast America. Limited occurrences in warm-temperate zones of south Europe and Asia and the Midwest USA.)

# T2.3 Oceanic cool temperate rainforests

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Broadleaf and needleleaf rainforests in cool temperate climates have evergreen or semi-deciduous tree canopies with high LAI and mostly nanophyll-microphyll foliage. Productivity is moderate to high and constrained by strongly seasonal growth and reproductive phenology and moderate levels of frost tolerance. SLA may be high but lower than in T2.2. Evergreen trees typically dominate, but deciduous species become more abundant in sites prone to severe
frost and/or with high soil fertility and moisture surplus. The smaller range of leaf sizes and SLA, varied phenology, frost tolerance, broader edaphic association and wetter, cooler climate distinguish these forests from warm temperate forests (T2.4). Local or regional endemism is significant in many taxa. Nonetheless, energy sources are primarily autochthonous. Trophic networks are less complex than in other cool-temperate or boreal forests (T2.1 and T2.2), with weaker top-down regulation due to the lower diversity and abundance of large herbivores and predators. Tree diversity is low (usually &lt;8–10 spp./ha), with abundant epiphytic and terrestrial bryophytes, pteridophytes, lichens, a modest range of herbs, and conspicuous fungi, which are important decomposers. The vertebrate fauna is mostly sedentary and of low-moderate diversity. Most plants recruit in the shade and some remain
in seedling banks until gap-phase dynamics are driven by individual tree-fall, lightning strikes, or by extreme wind storms in some areas. Tree recruitment varies with tree masting events, which strongly influence trophic dynamics, especially of rodents and their predators.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

There is a large water surplus, rarely with summer deficits. Rainfall is seasonal, borne on westerly winds peaking in winter months and inter-annual variability is relatively low. Cool winters (minima typically &lt;0–5°C for three months) limit the duration of the growing season. Maritime air masses are the major supply of climatic moisture and moderate winters and summer temperatures. Light may
be limited in winter by frequent cloud cover and high latitude.
Intermittent winter snow does not persist for more than a few days or weeks. Soils are moderately fertile to infertile and may accumulate peat. Exposure to winter storms and landslides leaves imprints on forest structure in some regions. Fires are rare, occurring on century time scales when lightning (or human) ignitions follow extended droughts.

## DISTRIBUTION

Cool temperate coasts of Chile and Patagonia, New Zealand, Tasmania and the Pacific Northwest, rarely extending to warm-temperate latitudes on mountains in Chile, southeast Australia, and outliers above 2,500-m elevation in the Papua New Guinea highlands. Some authors extend
the concept to wet boreal forests on the coasts of northwest Europe, Japan and northeast Canada.

# T2.4 Warm temperate laurophyll forests

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Relatively productive but structurally simple closed-canopy forests with high LAI occur in humid warm-temperate to subtropical climates. The tree canopies
are more uniform than most tropical forests (T1.1 and T1.2)
and usually lack large emergents. Their foliage is often leathery and glossy (laurophyll) with intermediate SLA values, notophyll- microphyll sizes and prodigiously evergreen. Deciduous species are rarely scattered within the forest canopies. These features, and drier, warmer climates and often more acid soils, distinguish them from oceanic cool temperate forests (T2.3), while in
the subtropics they transition to T1 forests. Autochthonous energy supports relatively high primary productivity, weakly limited by summer drought and sometimes by acid substrates. Forest function is regulated mainly by bottom-up processes related to resource competition rather than top-down trophic processes or disturbance regimes. Trophic structure is simpler than in tropical forests, with moderate levels of diversity and endemism among major taxa (i.e. typically &lt;20 tree spp./ha), but local assemblages of birds, bats and canopy invertebrates may be abundant and species-rich, and play important roles
in pollination and seed dispersal. Canopy insects are the major consumers of primary production and a major food source for birds. Decomposers and detritivores, such as invertebrates, fungi and microbes on the forest floor, are critical to nutrient cycling. Vertebrate herbivores are relatively uncommon, with low-moderate mammalian diversity. Although epiphytes and lianas are present, plant life-form traits that are typical of tropical forests (T1.1 and T1.2), such as buttress roots, compound leaves, monopodial growth and cauliflory, are uncommon
or absent in warm-temperate rainforests. Some trees have ecophysiological tolerance of acid soils (i.e. through aluminium accumulation). Gap-phase dynamics are driven by individual tree-fall and lightning strikes, but many trees are shade-tolerant and recruit slowly in the absence of disturbance. Ground vegetation includes varied growth forms but few grasses.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The environmental niche of these forests is defined by a modest overall water surplus with no distinct dry season, albeit moderate summer water deficits in some years. Mean annual rainfall is typically 1,200–2,500 mm, but topographic mesoclimates (e.g. sheltered gullies and orographic processes) sustain reliable moisture at some sites. Temperatures are mild with moderate seasonality and a growing season of 6–8 months, and mild frosts occur. Substrates may be acidic with high levels of Al and Fe that limit the uptake
of nutrients. These forests may be embedded in fire-prone landscapes but are typically not flammable due to their moist microclimates .

## DISTRIBUTION

Patchy warm temperate-subtropical distribution at 26–43° latitude, north or south of the Equator.

# T2.5 Temperate pyric humid forests

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

This group includes the tallest forests on earth. They are moist, multi-layered forests in wet-temperate climates with complex spatial structure and very high biomass and LAI. The upper layer is an open canopy of sclerophyllous trees 40–90 m tall with long, usually unbranched trunks. The open canopy structure allows light transmission sufficient for
the development of up to three subcanopy layers, consisting mostly of non-sclerophyllous trees and shrubs with higher
SLA than the upper canopy species. These forests are highly productive, grow rapidly, draw energy from autochthonous sources and store very large quantities of carbon, both above and below ground. They have complex trophic networks with
a diverse invertebrate, reptile, bird and mammal fauna with assemblages that live primarily in the tree canopy or the forest floor, and some that move regularly between vertical strata. Some species are endemic and have traits associated with
large trees, including the use of wood cavities, thick or loose bark, large canopies, woody debris, and deep, moist leaf litter. There is significant diversification of avian foraging methods and hence a high functional and taxonomic diversity of birds. High deposition rates of leaf litter and woody debris sustain diverse fungal decomposers and invertebrate detritivores and provide nesting substrates and refuges for ground mammals and avian insectivores. The shade-tolerant ground flora may include a diversity of ferns forbs, grasses (mostly C3) and bryophytes.
The dominant trees are shade-intolerant and depend on tree- fall gaps or periodic fires for regeneration. In cooler climates, trees are killed by canopy fires but may survive surface fires,
and canopy seedbanks are crucial to persistence. Epicormic resprouting (i.e. from aerial stems) is more common in warmer climates. Subcanopy and ground layers include both shade- tolerant and shade-intolerant plants, the latter with physically and physiologically dormant seedbanks that cue episodes of mass regeneration to fire. Multi-decadal or century-scale canopy fires consume biomass, liberate resources and trigger life-history processes in a range of biota. Seedbanks sustain plant diversity through storage effects.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

There is an annual water surplus with seasonal variation (peak surplus in winter) and rare major summer deficits associated with inter-annual drought cycles. Multiple tree layers produce a light diminution gradient and moist micro-climates at ground level. Winters are cool and summers are warm with occasional heatwaves that dry out
the moist micro-climate and enable periodic fires, which may
be extremely intense and consume the canopy. The growing season is 6–8 months; snow is uncommon and short-lived. Soils are relatively fertile, but often limited in Nitrogen.

## DISTRIBUTION

Subtropical - temperate southeast and temperate southwest Australia.

# T2.6 Temperate pyric sclerophyll forests and woodlands

BIOME: T2 TEMPERATE-BOREAL FORESTS AND WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Forests and woodlands, typically 10–30 m tall with an open evergreen sclerophyllous tree
canopy and low-moderate LAI grow in fire-prone temperate landscapes. Productivity is lower than other temperate and tropical forest systems, limited by low nutrient availability and summer water deficits. Abundant light and water (except in peak summer) enable the development of substantial biomass with high C:N ratios. Trees have microphyll foliage with low to very low SLA. Sclerophyll or subsclerophyll shrubs with low to very low SLA foliage form a prominent layer between the trees. A sparse ground layer of C3 and C4 tussock grasses and forbs becomes more prominent on soils of loamy texture. Diversity and local endemism may be high among some taxa including plants, birds, and some invertebrates such as dipterans and hemipterans. Low nutrients and summer droughts limit the diversity and abundance of higher trophic levels. Plant traits (e.g. sclerophylly, stomatal invagination, tubers and seedbanks) confer tolerance to pronounced but variable summer water deficits. Plants possess traits that promote the efficient capture and retention of nutrients, including specialised root structures, N-fixing bacterial associations, slow leaf turnover and high allocation of photosynthates to structural tissues and exudates. Consumers have traits that enable the consumption of high-fibre biomass. Mammalian herbivores (i.e. the folivorous koala) can exploit high-fibre content and phenolics. Plants and animals have morphological and behavioural traits that allow tolerance or avoidance of fire and the life-history processes of many taxa are cued to fire (especially plant recruitment). Key fire traits in plants include recovery organs protected by thick bark or burial, serotinous seedbanks (i.e. held in plant canopies), physical
and physiological seed dormancy and pyrogenic reproduction. Almost all plants are shade-intolerant and fire is a critical top- down regulator of diversity through storage effects and the periodic disruption of plant competition.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Hot summers generate a marked but variable summer water deficit, usually with a modest winter surplus, irrespective of whether rainfall is highly seasonal with winter maximum, aseasonal, or weakly seasonal with inter- annually variable summer maxima. Soils are acidic, sandy, or loamy in texture, and low to very impoverished in P and N. Hot summers define a marked season for canopy or surface fires at decadal to multi-decadal intervals. Light frost occurs periodically in some areas but snow is rare.

## DISTRIBUTION

Temperate regions of Australia, the Mediterranean, and central California.

# T3 Shrublands and shrubby woodlands biome

The Shrublands and shrub-dominated woodlands biome includes oligotrophic systems occurring on acidic, sandy soils that are often shallow or skeletal. Classically regarded as ‘azonal’ biomes or ‘pedobiomes’ (i.e. biomes determined by soils), they are scattered across all landmasses outside the polar regions, generally (but not always) closer to continental margins than to interior regions and absent from central Asia. Productivity and biomass are low to moderate and limited
by soil fertility. The effect of nutrient poverty on productivity
is exacerbated in tropical to mid-latitudes by water deficits occurring during either winter (tropics) or summer (temperate humid and Mediterranean climates) and by low insolation and cold temperatures at higher latitudes. Trophic networks are simple but the major functional components (photoautotrophic plants, decomposers, detritivores, herbivores and predators) are all represented and fuelled by autochthonous energy sources. Shrubs are the dominant primary producers and possess a
diversity of leaf and root traits as well as mutualistic relationships with soil microbes that promote the capture and conservation of nutrients. Recurrent disturbance events exert top-down regulation by consuming biomass, releasing resources, and triggering life-history processes (including recruitment and dispersal) in a range of organisms. Fire is the most widespread mechanism, with storms or mass movement of substrate less frequently implicated. Storage effects related to re-sprouting organs and seed banks appear to be important for maintaining plant diversity and hence structure and function in shrublands exposed to recurring fires and water deficits.

# T3.1 Seasonally dry tropical shrublands

BIOME: T3 SHRUBLANDS & SHRUBBY WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These moderate-productivity, mostly evergreen shrublands, shrubby grasslands and low, open forests (generally &lt;6 m tall) are limited by nutritional poverty
and strong seasonal drought in the tropical winter months. Taxonomic and functional diversity is moderate in most groups but with high local endemism in plants, invertebrates, birds and other taxa. Vegetation is spatially heterogeneous in a matrix of savannas (T4.2) or tropical dry forests (T1.2) and dominated
by sclerophyllous shrubs with small leaf sizes (nanophyll- microphyll) and low SLA. C4 grasses may be conspicuous or co-dominant (unlike in most temperate heathlands, T3.2) but generally do not form a continuous stratum as in savannas
(T4). These systems have relatively simple trophic networks fuelled by autochthonous energy sources. Productivity is low to moderate and constrained by seasonal drought and nutritional poverty. Shrubs are the dominant primary producers and show traits promoting the capture and conservation of nutrients (e.g. sclerophylly, cluster roots, carnivorous structures, and microbial and fungal root mutualisms) and tolerance to severe seasonal droughts (i.e. stomatal invagination). Nectarivorous and/or insectivorous birds and reptiles and granivorous small mammals dominate the vertebrate fauna, but vertebrate herbivores are sparse. Recurring fires play a role in the top-down regulation of ecosystem structure and composition.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

A severe seasonal climatic water deficit during tropical winter months is exacerbated by sandy or shallow rocky substrates with low moisture retention. Nutritional poverty (especially N and P) stems from oligotrophic, typically acid substrates, such as sandstones, ironstones, leached sand deposits, or rocky volcanic or ultramafic substrates. Vegetation holds the largest pool of nutrients. Temperatures are warm, rarely &lt;10°C, with low diurnal and seasonal variation. Dry-season fires recur on decadal or longer time scales, but they are rare in table-top mountains (tepui).

## DISTRIBUTION

Brazilian campos rupestres (where grasses are important), Venezuelan tepui, Peruvian tabletops, Florida sands, northern Australia and montane oceanic islands.

# T3.2 Seasonally dry temperate heaths and shrublands

BIOME: T3 SHRUBLANDS & SHRUBBY WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Sclerophyllous, evergreen shrublands are distinctive ecosystems of humid and subhumid climates in mid-latitudes. Their low-moderate productivity is fuelled by autochthonous energy sources and is limited by resource constraints and/or recurring disturbance. Vegetation
is dominated by shrubs with very low SLA, high C:N ratios, shade-intolerance, and long-lived, small, often ericoid leaves, with or without a low, open canopy of sclerophyll trees. The ground layer may include geophytes and sclerophyll graminoids, although less commonly true grasses. Trophic webs are simple, with large mammalian predators scarce or absent, and low densities of vertebrate herbivores. Native browsers may have local effects on vegetation. Diversity and local endemism may
be high among vascular plants and invertebrate consumers. Plants and animals have morphological, ecophysiological,
and life-history traits that promote persistence under summer droughts, nutrient poverty, and recurring fires, which play a role in top-down regulation. Stomatal regulation and root architecture promote drought tolerance in plants. Cluster roots and acid exudates, mycorrhizae and insectivory promote nutrient capture, while cellulose, lignin, exudate production and leaf longevity promote nutrient conservation in plants. Vertebrate herbivores and granivores possess specialised dietary and digestive traits enabling consumption of foliage with low nutrient content and secondary compounds. Decomposition rates are slow, allowing litter-fuel accumulation to add to well-aerated fine fuels in shrub canopies. Life-history traits, such as recovery organs, serotiny, post-fire seedling recruitment, pyrogenic flowering and fire- related germination cues, promote plant survival, growth and reproduction under recurring canopy fires. Animals evade fires
in burrows or through mobility. Animal pollination syndromes
are common (notably dipterans, lepidopterans, birds, and sometimes mammals) and ants may be prominent in seed dispersal.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

A marked summer water deficit and a modest winter surplus is driven by high summer temperatures and evapotranspiration with winter-maximum or aseasonal rainfall patterns. Winters are mild, or cool at high elevations. Sandy soil textures or reverse-texture effects of clay- loams exacerbate an overall water deficit. Soils are typically acid, derived from siliceous sand deposits, sandstones, or
acid intrusives or volcanics, and are low to very low in P, N and mineral cations (though this varies between regions, e.g, base- rich limestones, marl and dolomites in southern Europe). The climate, soils and vegetation promote summer canopy fires at decadal to multi-decadal intervals. Positive feedbacks between fire and vegetation may be important in maintaining flammability.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mediterranean-type climate regions
of Europe, north and south Africa, southern Australia, western North and South America, and occurrences in non- Mediterranean climates in eastern Australia, the USA, and Argentina.

# T3.3 Cool temperate heathlands

BIOME: T3 SHRUBLANDS & SHRUBBY WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These mixed graminoid shrublands are restricted to cool-temperate maritime environments. Typically, the vegetation cover is &gt;70% and mostly less than
1 m tall, dominated by low, semi-sclerophyllous shrubs with ferns and C3 graminoids. Shrub foliage is mostly evergreen
and ericoid, with low SLA or reduced to spiny stems. Modular growth forms are common among shrubs and grasses. Diversity and local endemism are low across taxa and the trophic network is relatively simple. Primary productivity is low, based on autochthonous energy sources and limited by cold temperatures and low-fertility acid soils rather than by water deficit (as in other heathlands, T3). Seasonally low light may limit productivity at the highest latitudes. Cool temperatures and low soil oxygen due to periodically wet subsoil limit decomposition by microbes and fungi so that soils accumulate organic matter despite low productivity. Mammalian browsers including cervids, lagomorphs and camelids (South America) consume local plant biomass but subsidise autochthonous energy with carbon and nutrients consumed in more productive forest or anthropogenic ecosystems adjacent to the heathlands. Browsers and
recurring low-intensity fires appear to be important in top-down regulatory processes that prevent the transition to forest, as
is anthropogenic fire, grazing, and tree removal. Canids and raptors are the main vertebrate predators. Other characteristic vertebrate fauna include ground-nesting birds and rodents.
At least some communities exhibit autogenic cyclical patch dynamics in which shrubs and grasses are alternately dominant, senescent and regenerating.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Unlike most other heathlands, these ecosystems have an overall water surplus, although sometimes with small summer deficits. Mild summers and cold winters with periodic snow are tempered by maritime climatic influences. A short day length and low solar angle limits energy influx at the highest latitudes. Severe coastal storms with high winds occur periodically. Acid soils, typically with high humic content in upper horizons, are often limited in N and P. Low-intensity fires recur at decadal time scales or rarely. Some northern European heaths were derived from forest and return to forest when burning and grazing ceases.

## DISTRIBUTION

Boreal and cool temperate coasts of western Europe and America, the Azores and the Magellanic region of South America, mostly at &gt;40° latitude, except where transitional with warm-temperate heaths (e.g. France and Spain).

# T3.4 Rocky pavements, lava flows and screes

BIOME: T3 SHRUBLANDS & SHRUBBY WOODLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Vegetation dominated by cryptogams (lichens, bryophytes), with scattered shrubs- with very low LAI develops on skeletal rocky substrates. These low-productivity systems are limited by moisture and nutrient scarcity, temperature extremes, and periodic disturbance through mass movement. Diversity and endemism is low
across taxa and the trophic structure is simple. Reptiles and ground-nesting birds are among the few resident vertebrates. Lichens and bryophytes may be abundant and perform
critical roles in moisture retention, nutrient acquisition, energy capture, surface stabilisation and proto-soil development, especially through carbon accumulation. N-fixing lichens and cyanobacteria, nurse plants and other mutualisms are critical
to ecosystem development. Rates of ecosystem development are linked to substrate weathering, decomposition and soil development, which mediate nutrient supply, moisture retention and temperature amelioration. Vascular plants have nanophyll- microphyll leaves and low SLA. Their cover is sparse and comprises ruderal pioneer species (shrubs, grasses and forbs) that colonise exposed surfaces and extract moisture from rock crevices. Species composition and vegetation structure are dynamic in response to surface instability and show limited differentiation across environmental gradients and microsites due to successional development, episodes of desiccation and periodic disturbances that destroy biomass. Rates of vegetation development, soil accumulation and compositional change display amplified temperature-dependence due to resource- concentration effects. Older rocky systems have greater micro- habitat diversity, more insular biota and higher endemism, and are classified in other functional groups.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Skeletal substrates (e.g. lava pavements, scree slopes and rock outcrops) limit water retention and nutrient capital and increase heat absorption, leading to periodically extreme temperatures. High summer temperatures and solar exposure concentrate resources and increase the temperature-sensitivity of biogeochemical processes. Winter temperatures may be cold at high elevations (see T6.2). Recurring geophysical disturbances, such as lava flow, mass movement and geothermal activity, as well as desiccation episodes, periodically destroy biomass and reset successional pathways.

## DISTRIBUTION

Localised areas scattered around the Pacific Rim, African Rift Valley, Mediterranean and north Atlantic.

# T4 Savannas and grasslands biome

Ecological functions within the Savannas and grasslands
biome are closely linked to a mostly continuous ground layer of grasses that contribute moderate to very high levels of primary productivity driven by strongly seasonal water surplus and deficit cycles. The timing of the seasonal cycle of productivity varies with latitude and becomes more variable inter-annually as total rainfall declines. The woody component of the vegetation may be completely absent or may vary to a height and stature that resembles that of a forest. In the tropics and subtropics, productivity peaks in the summer when high rainfall coincides with warm temperatures. At temperate latitudes, summer growth is suppressed by water deficits associated with high evapotranspiration, sometimes exacerbated by weakly seasonal (winter-maximum) rainfall, so that productivity peaks in spring when warming temperatures coincide with high soil moisture accumulated over winter. Co-existence between trees and grasses and between grasses and interstitial forbs is mediated
by herbivory and/or fire. These agents are critical in the top- down regulation of grassy ecosystems and in some cases are involved in feedback mechanisms that mediate regime shifts between alternative stable states. Herbivory is the primary driver in highly fertile and productive systems, whereas fire is the primary driver in less fertile and lower productivity systems. Nutrient gradients are exacerbated volatilisation during fire and the loss of nutrients in smoke. The representation of grass species with C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways varies with water availability and temperature over regional and continental climatic gradients. Grasses are rapid responders to seasonal pulses of elevated soil moisture and sustain a complex trophic web with large-bodied mammalian herbivores and their predators. The curing of grasses over the dry season is critical to flammability. Mammal diversity, trophic complexity, and the expression of physical and chemical defences against herbivory also vary with soil fertility.

# T4.1 Trophic savannas

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These grassy woodlands and grasslands are dominated by C4 grasses with stoloniferous, rhizomatous and tussock growth forms that are kept short by vertebrate grazers. Trophic savannas (relative to pyric savannas, T4.2) have unique plant and animal diversity within a complex trophic structure dominated by abundant mammalian herbivores and predators. These animals are functionally differentiated in body size, mouth morphology, diet and behaviour. They promote fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity and dominance of short grass species, sustaining the system through positive feedbacks and limiting fire fuels. Trees and grasses possess functional traits that promote tolerance to chronic herbivory as well as seasonal drought. Seasonal high productivity coincides with summer rains. The dry season induces grass curing and leaf fall in deciduous and semi-deciduous woody plants. Trees are shade- intolerant during their establishment and most develop chemical (i.e. phenolics) or physical (i.e. spinescence) herbivory defence traits and an ability to re-sprout as they enter the juvenile phase. Their soft microphyll-notophyll foliage has relatively high SLA and low C:N ratios, as do grasses. Robust root systems and stolons/ rhizomes enable characteristic grasses to survive and spread under heavy grazing. As well as vertebrate herbivores and predators, vertebrate scavengers and invertebrate detritivores are key components of the trophic network and carbon cycle. Nitrogen fixation, recycling and deposition by animals exceed volatilisation.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Trophic savannas like pyric savannas are driven by seasonal climates but generally occupy environmental niches with lower rainfall and higher soil fertility. High annual rainfall deficit of 400 mm to &gt;1,800 mm. Annual rainfall generally varies from 300 mm to 700 mm, always with strong seasonal (winter) drought, but these savanna types
are restricted to landscapes with sufficient water bodies (rivers and lakes) to sustain high densities of large mammals. Temperatures are warm-hot with low-moderate variability through the year. Low intensity fires have return intervals of 5–50 years, depending on animal densities and inter-annual rainfall variation, usually after the growing season, removing much of the remaining biomass not consumed by herbivores. Soils are moderately fertile and often have a significant clay component.

## DISTRIBUTION

Seasonal tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia.

# T4.2 Pyric tussock savannas

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Grassy woodlands and grasslands are dominated by C4 tussock grasses, with some C3 grasses in the Americas and variable tree cover. In the tropics, seasonally high productivity coincides with the timing of summer rains
and grasses cure in dry winters, promoting flammability. This pattern also occurs in the subtropics but transitions occur with temperate woodlands (T4.4), which have different seasonal phenology, tree and grass dominance and fire regimes. Tree basal area, abundance of plants with annual semelparous life cycles and abundant grasses with tall tussock growth forms are strongly dependent on mean annual rainfall (i.e. limited
by seasonal drought). Local endemism is low across all taxa
but regional endemism is high, especially in the Americas and Australasia. Plant traits, such as deciduous leaf phenology or deep roots, promote tolerance to seasonal drought and rapid resource exploitation. Woody plants have microphyll-notophyll foliage with moderate-high SLA and mostly high C:N ratios. Some C4 grasses nonetheless accumulate high levels of rubisco, which may push down C:N ratios. Nitrogen volatilisation exceeds deposition because fire is the major consumer of biomass. Woody plant species are shade-intolerant during their establishment and develop fire-resistant organs (e.g. thick bark and below-ground bud banks). The contiguous ground layer
of erect tussock grasses creates an aerated flammable fuel bed, while grass architecture with tightly clustered culms vents heat away from meristems. Patchy fires promote landscape- scale vegetation heterogeneity (i.e. in tree cover) and maintain the dominance of flammable tussock grasses over shrubs, especially in wetter climates, and hence sustain the system through positive feedbacks. Fires also enhance efficiency of predators. Vertebrate scavengers and invertebrate detritivores are key components of the trophic network and carbon cycle. Mammalian herbivores and predators are present but exert less top-down influence on the diverse trophic structure than fire. Consequently, plant physical defences against herbivores, such as spinescence, are less prominent than in T4.1.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

An overall rainfall deficit up
to ~1,200 mm or a modest surplus of up to 500 mm, always with strong seasonal (winter) drought with continuously warm- hot temperatures through the year even though rainfall become less seasonal in the subtropics. Mean annual rainfall varies from 650 mm to 1,500 mm. Sub-decadal fire regimes of surface fires occur throughout the dry season, while canopy fires occur rarely late in the dry season. Soils are of low-moderate fertility, often with high Fe and Al.

## DISTRIBUTION

Seasonally dry tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Australia, Asia, and Africa.

# T4.3 Hummock savannas

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These open woodlands are dominated by C4 hummock grasses (C3 and stoloniferous grasses are absent) with sclerophyllous trees and shrubs. Their primary productivity is lower and less regularly seasonal than in other savannas of the subtropics (T4.1 and T4.2),
but the seasonal peak nonetheless coincides with summer monsoonal rains. Plant traits promote tolerance to seasonal drought, including reduced leaf surfaces, thick cuticles,
sunken stomata and deep root architecture to access subsoil moisture. Deciduous leaf phenology is less common than in other savannas, likely due to selection pressure for nutrient conservation associated with oligotrophic substrates. A major feature distinguishing this group of savannas from others is its ground layer of slow-growing sclerophyllous, spiny, domed hummock grasses interspersed with bare ground. Woody biomass and LAI decline along rainfall gradients. Sclerophyll shrubs and trees are shade-intolerant during establishment and most possess fire-resistant organs (e.g. thick bark, epicormic meristematic tissues and below-ground bud banks). Their notophyll foliage and that of hummock grasses has low SLA and mostly high C:N ratios, although N may be elevated in rubisco- enriched C4 grasses. Trophic structure is therefore simpler than in others savannas. Mammalian herbivores and their predators are present in low densities, but fire and invertebrates are the major biomass consumers. Fire promotes landscape-scale vegetation heterogeneity but occurs less frequently than in other savannas due to slow recovery of perennial hummock grass fuels. Nitrogen volatilisation exceeds deposition due to recurring fires.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Large overall rainfall deficit up to ~2,000 mm, always with a seasonal (winter) drought, but in drier areas seasonality is weaker than in other savanna groups. Mean annual rainfall is generally 400–1,000 mm. Climatic water deficit is exacerbated by coarse-textured, usually shallow, rocky soils. These are characteristically infertile. Temperatures are warm-hot with moderate seasonal and diurnal variability. Fires promoted by flammable hummocks may consume the low tree canopies and occur at variable decadal intervals any time when it is dry, but fire spread depends on ground fuel continuity which is limited by rainfall and rocky terrain.

## DISTRIBUTION

Rocky areas of the seasonal Australian tropics, extending to the semi-arid zone.

# T4.4 Temperate woodlands

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These structurally simple woodlands are characterised by space between open tree crowns
and a ground layer with tussock grasses, interstitial forbs,
and a variable shrub component. Grasses with C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways are common, but C4 grasses may be absent from the coldest and wettest sites or where rain rarely falls in the summer. In any given area, C4 grasses are most abundant in summer or on dry sites or areas with summer- dominant rainfall, while C3 grasses predominate in winter, locally moist sites, cold sites, or areas without summer rainfall. The ground flora also varies inter-annually depending on rainfall. Trees generate spatial heterogeneity in light, water and nutrients, which underpin a diversity of microhabitats and mediate competitive interactions among plants in the ground layer. Foliage is mostly microphyll and evergreen (but transmitting abundant light) or deciduous in colder climates. Diversity of plant and invertebrate groups may therefore be relatively high at local scales, but local endemism is limited due to long-distance dispersal. Productivity is relatively high as grasses rapidly produce biomass rich in N and other nutrients after rains. This sustains a relatively complex trophic network of invertebrate
and vertebrate consumers. Large herbivores and their predators are important top-down regulators. Bioturbation by fossorial mammals influences soil structure, water infiltration, and nutrient cycling. The fauna is less functionally and taxonomically diverse than in most tropical savannas (T4.1 and T4.2), but includes large and small mammals, reptiles and a high diversity of birds and macro-invertebrates, including grasshoppers, which are major consumers of biomass. Plants and animals tolerate and persist through periodic ground fires that consume cured-
grass fuels, but few have specialised traits cued to fire (cf. pyric ecosystems such as T2.6).

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

A water deficit occurs seasonally in summer, driven primarily by peak evapotranspiration under warm-hot temperatures and, in some regions, seasonal (winter-maximum) rainfall patterns. Mean annual rainfall is 350–1,000 mm. Low winter temperatures and occasional frost and snow may limit the growing season to 6–9 months. Soils are usually fine-textured and fertile, but N may be limiting in some areas. Fires burn, mostly in the ground layers, during the drier summer months at decadal intervals.

## DISTRIBUTION

Temperate southeast and southwest Australia, Patagonia and Pampas of South America, western and eastern North America, the Mediterranean region, and temperate Eurasia.

# T4.5 Temperate subhumid grasslands

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Structurally simple tussock grasslands with interstitial forbs occur in subhumid temperate climates. Isolated trees or shrubs may be present in very low densities, but are generally excluded by heavy soil texture, summer drought, winter frost, or recurring summer fires.
Unlike tropical savannas (T4.1–T4.3), these systems are characterised by a mixture of both C3 and C4 grasses, with
C4 grasses most abundant in summer or on dry sites and
C3 grasses predominating in winter or locally moist sites.
There are also strong latitudinal gradients, with C3 grasses
more dominant towards the poles. Diversity of plant and invertebrate groups may be high at small spatial scales, but local endemism is limited due to long-distance dispersal. Productivity is high as grasses rapidly produce biomass rich
in N and other nutrients after rains. This sustains a complex trophic network in which large herbivores and their predators are important top-down regulators. Fossorial mammals are important in bioturbation and nutrient cycling. Mammals are less functionally and taxonomically diverse than in most savannas. Taxonomic affinities vary among regions (e.g. ungulates, cervids, macropods and camelids), but their life history and dietary traits are convergent. Where grazing is not intense and fire occurs infrequently, leaf litter accumulates from the tussocks, creating
a thatch that is important habitat for ground-nesting birds,
small mammals, reptiles and macro-invertebrates, including grasshoppers, which are major consumers of plant biomass. Dense thatch limits productivity. Plant competition plays a
major role in structuring the ecosystem and its dynamics,
with evidence that it is mediated by resource ratios and stress gradients, herbivory and fire regimes. Large herbivores and fires both interrupt competition and promote coexistence of tussocks and interstitial forbs.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

A strong seasonal water deficit in summer driven by peak evapotranspiration under warm-hot temperatures, despite an unseasonal or weakly seasonal rainfall pattern. Mean annual rainfall varies from 250 mm to 750 mm. Cold winter temperatures limit the growing season to 5–7 months, with frost and snow frequent in continental locations. Summers are warm. Soils are deep, fertile and organic and usually fine-textured. Fires ignited by lightning occur in the drier summer months at sub-decadal or decadal intervals.

## DISTRIBUTION

Western Eurasia, northeast Asia, Midwest North America, Patagonia and Pampas regions of South America, southeast Africa, southeast Australia, and southern New Zealand.

# T5 Deserts and semi-deserts biome

The Deserts and semi-deserts biome includes low to very low biomass ecosystems occurring in arid or semi-arid climates, principally associated with the subtropical high-pressure belts and major continental rain shadows. Primary productivity is
low or very low and dependent on low densities of low-stature photoautotrophs that sustain a complete but sparse trophic web of consumers and predators. Productivity is limited by severe water deficits caused by very low rainfall. Rainfall deficits are exacerbated by extremes of temperature and desiccating winds. Resources, productivity and biomass are highly variable in space and time in response to the amount of annual rainfall, the size of individual rainfall events, and the lateral movement of resources from sources to sinks. Landscape heterogeneity and resource gradients are therefore critical to the persistence of desert biota in the context of highly stochastic, unseasonal temporal patterns of rainfall events that drive ‘pulse and reserve’ or ‘boom-bust’ ecosystem dynamics. There may be high rates of erosion and
sedimentation due to the lack of surface stability provided by the sparse vegetation cover and this can be amplified by the activities of large mammals and people. Extreme and prolonged water deficits, punctuated by short episodes of surplus, impose severe physiological constraints on plants and animals, which exhibit a variety of physiological, morphological, behavioural and life-history traits enabling water acquisition and conservation. The life-history spectra of desert systems are polarised between long-lived drought tolerators with low metabolic rates and opportunistic drought evaders with either high mobility or short- lived active phases and long dormant phases. Mobility enables organisms to track transient resources over large distances. Competitive interactions are weak, although herbivory and predation are more evident in the most productive ecosystems and during the decline in resource availability that follows rainfall events.

# T5.1 Semi-desert steppes

BIOME: T5 DESERTS AND SEMI-DESERTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These mixed semi-deserts are dominated by suffrutescent (i.e. with a woody base) or sub-succulent (semi-fleshy) perennial shrubs and tussock grasses. Productivity and biomass are limited by low average precipitation, extreme temperatures and, to a lesser extent, soil nutrients, but vary temporally in response to water availability. Vegetation takes a range of structural forms, including open shrublands, mixed shrublands with a tussock grass matrix, prairie-like tall forb grasslands, and very low dwarf shrubs interspersed with forbs or grasses. Total cover varies from
10% to 30% and the balance between shrubs and grasses is mediated by rainfall, herbivory and soil fertility. Stress-tolerator and ruderal life-history types are strongly represented in flora and fauna. Trait plasticity and nomadism are also common. Traits promoting water capture and conservation in plants include xeromorphy, deep roots, and C4 photosynthesis.
Shrubs have small (less than nanophyll), non-sclerophyll, often hairy leaves with moderate SLA. Shrubs act as resource- accumulation sites, promoting heterogeneity over local scales. C3 photosynthesis is represented in short-lived shrubs, forbs and grasses, enabling them to exploit pulses of winter rain. Consumers include small mammalian and avian granivores, medium-sized mammalian herbivores, and wide-ranging large mammalian and avian predators and scavengers. Abundant detritivores consume dead matter and structure resource availability and habitat characteristics over small scales. Episodic rainfall initiates trophic pulses with rapid responses by granivores and their predators, but less so by herbivores, which show multiple traits promoting water conservation.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Semi-desert steppes are associated with fine-textured, calcareous soils of low-moderate fertility, and may contain appreciable levels of magnesium or sodium. Clay particles exchange mineral ions with plant roots and have ‘reverse texture effects’, limiting moisture extraction as soils dry. Indurated subsoils influence infiltration/runoff relationships and vegetation patterns. Semi-desert steppes are not typically fire-prone and occur in temperate-arid climates. Mean annual rainfall ranges from ~150 to 300 mm, with a winter maximum. Evapotranspiration is 2–20 times greater than precipitation, but large rain events bring inter-annual pulses of water surplus. Temperatures are highly variable diurnally and seasonally, often exceeding 40°C in summer and reaching 0°C in winters but rarely with snow.

## DISTRIBUTION

Extensive areas across the Sahara, the Arabian Peninsula, west Asia, southwest Africa, southern Australia, Argentina, and the Midwest USA.

# T5.2 Succulent or Thorny deserts and semi-deserts

BIOME: T5 DESERTS AND SEMI-DESERTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These deserts are characterised by long-lived perennial plants, many with spines and/or succulent stem tissues or leaves. Local endemism is prominent among plants and animals. Productivity is low but relatively consistent through time and limited by precipitation and extreme summer temperatures. Vegetation cover is sparse to moderate (10–30%) and up to several metres tall. Dominant plants are stress- tolerators with slow growth and reproduction, many exhibiting CAM physiology and traits that promote water capture, conservation and storage. These include deep root systems, suffrutescence, plastic growth and reproduction, succulent stems and/or foliage, thickened cuticles, sunken stomata,
and deciduous or reduced foliage. Spinescence in many
species is likely a physical defence to protect moist tissues
from herbivores. Annuals and geophytes constitute a variable proportion of the flora exhibiting rapid population growth or flowering responses to semi-irregular rainfall events, which stimulate germination of soil seed banks or growth from dormant subterranean organs. Mammalian, reptilian and invertebrate faunas are diverse, with avian fauna less well represented. Faunal traits adaptive to drought and heat tolerance include physiological mechanisms (e.g. specialised kidney function
and reduced metabolic rates) and behavioural characters
(e.g. nocturnal habit and burrow dwelling). Many reptiles and invertebrates have ruderal life histories, but fewer mammals and birds do. Larger ungulate fauna exhibit flexible diets and forage over large areas. Predators are present in low densities due to the low productivity of prey populations.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These systems occur
in subtropical arid climates with large overall water deficits. Precipitation is 5–20% of potential evapotranspiration, but exhibits low inter-annual variability relative to other desert systems. Inter-annual pulses of surplus are infrequent and atmospheric moisture from fogs may contribute significantly to available water. Temperatures are hot with relatively large diurnal ranges, but seasonal variation is less than in other deserts, with very hot summers and mild winters. Substrates are stony and produce soils of moderate to low fertility. Thorny deserts are generally not fire-prone.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mostly subtropical latitudes in the Americas, southern Africa, and southern Asia.

# T5.3 Sclerophyll hot deserts and semi- deserts

BIOME: T5 DESERTS AND SEMI-DESERTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Arid systems dominated by hard- leaved (sclerophyll) vegetation have relatively high diversity
and local endemism, notably among plants, reptiles and small mammals. Large moisture deficits and extremely low levels of soil nutrients limit productivity, however, infrequent episodes
of high rainfall drive spikes of productivity and boom-bust ecology. Spatial heterogeneity is also critical in sustaining diversity by promoting niche diversity and resource-rich
refuges during ‘bust’ intervals. Stress-tolerator and ruderal life-history types are strongly represented in both flora and fauna. Perennial, long-lived, slow-growing, drought-tolerant, sclerophyll shrubs and hummock (C4) grasses structure the ecosystem by stabilising soils, acting as nutrient-accumulation sites and providing continuously available habitat, shade and food for fauna. Strong filtering by both nutritional poverty and water deficit promote distinctive scleromorphic and xeromorphic plant traits. They include low SLA, high C:N ratios, reduced foliage, stomatal regulation and encryption, slow growth and reproduction rates, deep root systems, and trait plasticity. Perennial succulents are absent. Episodic rains initiate emergence of a prominent ephemeral flora, with summer and winter rains favouring grasses and forbs, respectively. This productivity ‘boom’ triggers rapid responses by granivores and their predators. Herbivore populations also fluctuate but less so due to ecophysiological traits that promote water conservation. Abundant detritivores support a diverse and abundant resident reptilian and small-mammal fauna. Small mammals and some macro-invertebrates are nocturnal and fossorial, with digging activity contributing to nutrient and carbon cycling, as well as plant recruitment. The abundance and diversity of top predators is low. Nomadism and ground-nesting are well represented in birds. Periodic fires reduce biomass, promote recovery traits in plants (e.g. re-sprouting and fire-cued recruitment) and initiate successional processes in both flora and fauna.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Resource availability is limited by a large overall water deficit (rainfall &lt;250 mm p.a., 5–50%
of potential evapotranspiration) and acid sandy soils with very low P and N, together with high diurnal and seasonal variation in temperatures. Summers have runs of extremely hot days (&gt;40°C) and winters have cool nights (0°C), rarely with snow. Long dry spells are punctuated by infrequent inter-annual pulses of water surplus, driving ecological booms and transient periods of fuel continuity. Fires occur at decadal- or century-scale return intervals when lightning or human ignitions coincide with fuel continuity.

## DISTRIBUTION

Mid-latitudes on sandy substrates of central and northwestern Australia.

# T5.4 Cool deserts and semi-deserts

BIOME: T5 DESERTS AND SEMI-DESERTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

In these arid systems, productivity
is limited by both low precipitation and cold temperatures but
varies spatially in response to soil texture, salinity, and water
table depth. Vegetation cover varies with soil conditions from
near zero (on extensive areas of heavily salinized soils or mobile
dunes) to &gt;50% in upland grasslands and shrublands, but is
generally low in stature (&lt;1 m tall). The dominant plants are
perennial C3 grasses and xeromorphic suffrutescent or non-sclerophyllous perennial shrubs. Dwarf shrubs, tending to prostrate or cushion forms occur in areas exposed to strong, cold winds. Plant growth occurs mainly during warming spring temperatures after winter soil moisture recharges. Eurasian winter annuals grow rapidly in this period after developing extensive root systems over winter. Diversity and local endemism are low across all taxa relative to other arid ecosystems. Trophic networks are characterised by large nomadic mammalian herbivores. Vertebrate herbivores, including antelopes, equines, camelids and lagomorphs, are important mediators of shrub- grass dynamics, with heavy grazing promoting replacement
of grasses by N-fixing shrubs. Grasses become dominant
with increasing soil fertility or moisture but may be replaced by shrubs as grazing pressure increases. Fossorial lagomorphs and omnivorous rodents perturb soils. Predator populations are sparse but taxonomically diverse. They include raptors, snakes, bears and cats. Bio-crusts with cyanobacteria, mosses, and lichens are prominent on fine-textured substrates, and become dominant where it is too cold for vascular plants. They play critical roles in soil stability and water and nutrient availability.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Mean annual precipitation is similar to most warm deserts (&lt;250 mm) due to rain shadows and continentality, however, in cool deserts this falls mainly as snow or sleet in winter rather than rain. Although evapotranspiration is less severe than in hot deserts, a substantial water deficit exists due to low precipitation (mostly 10–50% of evapotranspiration) and strong desiccating
winds that may occasionally propagate fires. Mean monthly temperatures may fall below −20°C in winter (freezing the soil surface) and exceed 15°C in summer. Substrates vary from stony plains and uplands to extensive dune fields, with mosaics of clay and sandy regolith underpinning landscape-scale heterogeneity. Large regions were submerged below seas or lakes in past geological eras with internal drainage systems leaving significant legacies of salinity in some lowland areas, especially in clay substrates.

## DISTRIBUTION

Cool temperate plains and plateaus from sea level to 4,000 m elevation in central Eurasia, western North America, and Patagonia. Extreme cold deserts are placed in the polar/alpine biome.

# T5.5 Hyper-arid deserts

BIOME: T5 DESERTS AND SEMI-DESERTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Hyper-arid deserts show extremely low productivity and biomass and are limited by low precipitation and extreme temperatures. Vegetation cover is very sparse (&lt;1%) and low in stature (typically a few centimetres tall),
but productivity and biomass may be marginally greater in topographically complex landscapes within patches of rising ground-water or where runoff accumulates or cloud cover intersects. Trophic networks are simple because autochthonous productivity and allochthonous resources are very limited.
Rates of decomposition are slow and driven by microbial
activity and UV-B photodegradation, both of which decline with precipitation. Microbial biofilms play important decomposition roles in soils and contain virus lineages that are putatively distinct from other ecosystems. Although diversity is low, endemism may be high because of strong selection pressures and insularity resulting from the large extent of these arid regions and limited dispersal abilities of most organisms. Low densities of drought-tolerant perennial plants (xerophytes) characterise these systems. The few perennials present have very slow growth and tissue turnover rates, low fecundity, generally long life spans, and water acquisition and conservation traits (e.g. extensive root systems, thick cuticles, stomatal regulation, and succulent organs). Ephemeral plants with long-lived soil seed banks are well represented in hyper-arid deserts characterised by episodic rainfall, but they are less common in those that are largely reliant on fog or groundwater. Fauna include both ruderal and drought-tolerant species. Thermoregulation is strongly represented in reptiles and invertebrates. Birds and large mammals are sparse and nomadic, except in areas with reliable standing water. Herbivores and granivores have boom-bust population dynamics coincident with episodic rains.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Extreme rainfall deficit arising from very low rainfall (150 mm to almost zero and &lt;5% of potential evapotranspiration), exacerbated by extremely
hot temperatures and desiccating winds. Principal sources of moisture may include moisture-laden fog, irregular inter-annual
or decadal rainfall events, and capillary rise from deep water tables. UV-B radiation is extreme except where moderated by fogs. Temperatures exhibit high diurnal and seasonal variability with extreme summer maxima and sub-zero winter night temperatures. Hyper-arid deserts occur on extensive low-relief plains (peneplains) and mountainous terrain. Substrates may be extensive sheets of unstable, shifting sand or stony gibber with no soil profile development and low levels of nutrients.

## DISTRIBUTION

Driest parts of the Sahara-Arabian, Atacama, and Namib deserts in subtropical latitudes.
