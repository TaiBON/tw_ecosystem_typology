# SF1 Subterranean freshwaters biome

The Subterranean freshwaters biome includes streams,
small lakes and aquifers beneath the earth’s surface and potentially has the largest volume of water of all the freshwater biomes. In the absence of sunlight, these ecosystems rely on allochthonous energy sourced from surface ecosystems via connected waters and in situ chemoautotrophs. Depending on the mode of connectivity to the surface, water flow- through varies from extremely rapid to slow. Highly connected subterranean streams in monsoonal climates undergo seasonal flooding and drying cycles. In contrast, paleo- aquifers are characterised by slow, low-variability seepage over millennial time scales. Inflowing water is the principal source of dissolved oxygen and mineral nutrients, although some nutrients are liberated by in situ weathering of lithic substrates. The water regime largely determines environmental variability in subterranean freshwaters, but these systems may occasionally be influenced by mass movements. The trophic structure of subterranean waters is typically truncated, although photosynthetically inactive, algae and higher-plant propagules may be transient occupants in systems that are connected to the surface. Chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic microbes
in biofilms and the water column dominate the trophic web, supporting small invertebrate detritivores and predators. Small predatory fish may occur in streams and lakes, where voids
in the subsurface are of sufficient size. Productivity, metabolic rates, life histories and the diversity of the biota all reflect resource scarcity but may vary depending on water source. Insular systems exhibit high levels of endemism.

# SF1.1 Underground streams and pools

BIOME: SF1 SUBTERRANEAN FRESHWATER SYSTEMS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL SUBTERRANEAN-FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Subterranean streams, pools and aquatic voids (flooded caves) are low-productivity systems devoid of light. The taxonomic and functional diversity of
these water bodies is low, but they may host local endemics, depending on connectivity with surface waters and between cave systems. The truncated trophic network is entirely heterotrophic, with no photosynthetic primary producers or herbivores. Detritivores and their predators are dominant, although a few specialist predators may be associated with resource-rich hotspots. Microbial mats composed of bacteria and aquatic fungi covering submerged rock surfaces are
major food sources for protozoans and invertebrates. Other biota include planktonic bacteria, crustaceans, annelids, molluscs, arachnids and fish in larger voids. Chemoautotrophic proteobacteria are locally abundant in sulphur-rich waters fed by springs but not widespread. Obligate denizens of subterranean waters complete their life cycles entirely below ground and derive from relatively few evolutionary lineages. These make
up a variable portion of the biota, depending on connectivity
to surface waters. Most species are generalist detritivores coexisting under weak competitive interactions. Some are
also opportunistic predators, reflecting selection pressures
of food scarcity. Distinctive traits include the absence of eyes and pigmentation, long lifespans, slow metabolism and growth rates and low fecundity. Less-specialised biota include taxa that spend part of their life cycles below ground and part above,
as well as temporary below-ground inhabitants. Transient vertebrates occur only in waters of larger subterranean voids that are well connected to surface streams with abundant food.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Most caves form from chemical weathering of soluble rocks, such as limestone or dolomite, and others include lava tunnels. Cave waters are devoid of light, typically low in dissolved oxygen nutrients,
and food, and exhibit low variability in temperature. Water chemistry reflects substrate properties (i.e. high Calcium levels in limestone voids). Resource supply and biotic dispersal depend on connectivity with surface waters and flow velocity and turbulence. In the absence of light, surface-connected streams are major allochthonous sources of energy and nutrients. Disconnected systems are the most biologically insular and oligotrophic, and may also be limited by nutrient imbalance. These features promote insular evolution in stable conditions.

## DISTRIBUTION

Scattered worldwide, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere in limestone (map) and more rarely in basalt flows and other lithic substrates.

# SF1.2 Groundwater ecosystems

BIOME: SF1 SUBTERRANEAN FRESHWATER SYSTEMS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL SUBTERRANEAN-FRESHWATER

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These low-productivity ecosystems are found within or below groundwater (phreatic) zones.
They include aquifers (underground layers of water-saturated permeable rock or unconsolidated gravel, sand, or silt) and hyporheic zones beneath rivers and lakes (i.e. where shallow groundwater and surface water mix). Diversity and abundance of biota decline with depth and connectivity to surface waters, as do nutrients (i.e. most meiofauna is limited to 100 m
deep). Microbial communities are functionally diverse and invertebrate taxa exhibit high local endemism where aquifers are poorly connected. Trophic networks are truncated and comprised almost exclusively of heterotrophic microbes and invertebrates. Chemoautotrophic bacteria are the only source of autochthonous energy. Herbivores only occur where plant material enters groundwater systems (i.e. in well-connected hyporheic zones). Microbes and their protozoan predators dwell on particle surfaces rather than in pore water. They
play key roles in weathering and mineral formation, engineer chemically distinctive microhabitats through redox reactions, and are repositories of Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus
within the ecosystem. Meio-faunal detritivores and predators transfer Carbon and nutrients from biofilms to larger invertebrate predators such as crustaceans, annelids, nematodes, water mites and beetles. These larger trophic generalists live in interstitial waters, either browsing on particle biofilms or ingesting sediment grains, digesting their surface microbes,
and excreting ‘cleaned’ grains. They have morphological and behavioural traits that equip them for life in dark, resource- scarce groundwater where space is limited. These include slow metabolism and growth, long lifespans without resting stages, low fecundity, lack of pigmentation, reduced eyes, enhanced non-optic sensory organs and elongated body shapes with enhanced segmentation. Much of the biota belongs to ancient subterranean lineages that have diverged sympatrically within aquifers or allopatrically from repeated colonisations or aquifer fragmentation.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Groundwater ecosystems are characterised by a scarcity of nutrients, Carbon, dissolved oxygen and free space, and an absence of light. They occur within basin fill or other porous geological strata. Groundwater flow, pore size, interstitial biogeochemistry and hydrological conductivity to adjacent aquifers and surface waters determine ecosystem properties. Subsurface water residence times
vary from days in shallow, well-connected, coarse-grained hyporheic systems to thousands of years in deep, poorly connected aquifers confined between impermeable rock strata. Lack of connectivity promotes insularity and endemism as
well as reductive biogeochemical processes that influence the availability of food and nutrients.
