# MT2 Supralittoral coastal biome

The Supralittoral coastal biome marks the landward extent of the transition from marine to terrestrial biomes. It is elevated above the direct influence of waves and tides (see MT1) and beyond the direct influence of freshwater seepage or rivers
(see MFT1). Supratidal coastal ecosystems extend around
all the worldâ€™s land masses, occupying a fringe from tens of metres to a few kilometres wide and covering the entire extent of many small islands. Onshore winds, created by differences
in air pressure related to the differing heat capacities of water and dry land, are a key driver of ecosystem function. These winds create desiccating conditions on elevated landforms, such as headlands and coastal dunes, as well as continual inputs of aerosol salts and salt spray. Even though the supralittoral zone is located above high spring tide, it is exposed to recurring disturbance from storms producing exceptional waves and tides that reduce standing biomass and destabilise substrates. These strong environmental gradients select for a
specialised, low-diversity biota. Much of this biota is confined to supralittoral ecosystems and nowhere else, a key feature
of these ecosystems, although it may be widely distributed behind shorelines on different land masses due to dispersal by coastal winds, oceanic currents, and/or migratory behaviour. Autochthonous energy is produced by wind-pruned vegetation with traits promoting tolerance to desiccation, high salinity
and substrate instability (e.g. stomatal regulation, extensive rhizomes or root systems and succulence). The sea supplies allochthonous energy subsidies, such as wrack and guano, but also transports a portion of primary production to other ecosystems. Invertebrate detritivores and physical weathering contribute to rapid decay. Supralittoral ecosystems also provide nesting habitat for seabirds on the surface, in vegetation or in burrows, especially on islands free from terrestrial mammalian predators.

REALM: TRANSITIONAL MARINE-TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Relatively low productivity grasslands, shrublands and low forests on exposed coastlines are limited by salt influx, water deficit and recurring disturbances. Diversity is low across taxa and trophic networks are simple, but virtually all plants and animals have strong dispersal traits and most consumers move between adjacent terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Vegetation and substrates are characterised by strong gradients from sea to land, particularly related to aerosol salt inputs, substrate instability and disturbance associated
with sea storms and wave action. Plant traits conferring salt tolerance (e.g. succulent and sub-succulent leaves and salt- excretion organs) are commonly represented. Woody plants
with ramulose and/or decumbent growth forms and small (microphyll-nanophyll) leaves reflect mechanisms of persistence under exposure to strong salt-laden winds, while modular and rhizomatous growth forms of woody and non-woody plants promote persistence, regeneration and expansion under regimes of substrate instability and recurring disturbance. These strong environmental filters promote local adaptation, with specialised genotypes and phenotypes of more widespread
taxa commonly represented on the strandline. Fauna are highly mobile, although some taxa, such as ground-nesting seabirds, may be sedentary for some parts of their lifecycles. Ecosystem dynamics are characterised by disturbance-driven cycles
of disruption and renewal, with early phases dominated by colonists and in situ regenerators that often persist during the short intervals between successive disturbances.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Desiccating winds promote an overall water deficit and appreciable exposure to salinity
due to aerosol influx and salt spray. Warm to mild temperatures across the tropics to temperate zones and cold temperatures
in the cool temperate to boreal zones are moderated by direct maritime influence. Above the regular intertidal zone, these systems are exposed to periodic disturbance from exceptional tides, coastal storm events, wind shear, bioturbation and aeolian substrate mobility. Consolidated substrates (headlands, cliffs) may differ from unconsolidated dunes in their influence on function and biota. Geomorphological depositional and erosional processes influence substrate stability and local vegetation succession.

## DISTRIBUTION

Coastal dunes and cliffs throughout tropical, temperate, and boreal latitudes.
