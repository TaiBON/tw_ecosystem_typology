# T1 Tropical-subtropical forests biome

The Tropical-subtropical forests biome includes moderate to highly productive ecosystems with closed tree canopies occurring at lower latitudes north and south of the equator. Fragmented occurrences extend to the subtropics in suitable mesoclimates. High primary productivity is underpinned by high insolation, warm temperatures, relatively low seasonal variation in day length and temperature (increasing to the subtropics), and strong water surpluses associated with the intertropical convergence zone extending to wetter parts of the seasonal tropics and subtropics. Productivity and biomass vary in response to: i) strong rainfall gradients associated with seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone; ii) altitudinal gradients in precipitation, cloud cover, and temperatures; and iii) edaphic gradients that influence the availability of soil nutrients. Species diversity and the complexity of both vegetation and trophic structures are positively correlated with standing biomass and primary productivity; however, trophic webs and other ecosystem processes are strongly regulated from the bottom-up by the dominant photoautotrophs (trees), which fix abundant energy and carbon, engineer habitats for many other organisms, and underpin feedbacks related to nutrient and water cycling and regional climate. Complex nutrient cycling and/or sequestering mechanisms are common, countering the high potential for soil nutrient leaching due to high rainfall. Plant species exhibit leaf plasticity, shade tolerance and gap-phase dynamics in response to the periodic opening of canopy gaps initiated by tree death, storm damage, and lightning strikes. Fires may occur in ecotonal areas between these forests and savannas. Biogeographic legacies result in strong compositional distinctions and consequently some functional differences among land masses within the biome.

REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These closed-canopy forests
are renowned for their complex structure and high primary productivity, which support high functional and taxonomic diversity. At subtropical latitudes they transition to warm temperate forests (T2.4). Bottom-up regulatory processes are fuelled by large autochthonous energy sources that support very high primary productivity, biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI). The structurally complex, multi-layered, evergreen tree canopy has a large range of leaf sizes (typically macrophyll- notophyll) and high SLA, reflecting rapid growth and turnover. Diverse plant life forms include buttressed trees, bamboos (sometimes abundant), epiphytes, lianas and ferns, but
grasses and hydrophytes are absent or rare. Trophic networks are complex and vertically stratified with low exclusivity
and diverse representation of herbivorous, frugivorous and carnivorous vertebrates. Tree canopies support a vast diversity of invertebrate herbivores and their predators. Mammals and birds play critical roles in plant diaspore dispersal and pollination. Growth and reproductive phenology may be seasonal or unseasonal, and reproductive masting is common in trees and regulates diaspore predation. Fungal, microbial and diverse invertebrate decomposers and detritivores dominate the forest floor and the subsoil. Diversity is high across taxa, especially
at the upper taxonomic levels of trees, vertebrates, fungi and invertebrate fauna. Neutral processes as well as micro-niche partitioning may have a role in sustaining high diversity, but evidence is limited. Many plants are in the shade, forming seedling banks that exploit gap-phase dynamics initiated by individual tree-fall or stand-level canopy disruption by tropical storms in near coastal forests. Seed banks regulated by dormancy are uncommon. Many trees exhibit leaf form plasticity enabling photosynthetic function in deep shade, dappled light or full sun, even on a single individual. Some species germinate on tree trunks, gaining quicker access to canopy light, while roots absorb microclimatic moisture until they reach the soil.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration with low intra- and inter-annual variability, creating a reliable year-round surplus, while closed tree canopies maintain humid microclimate and shade. Temperatures are warm with low-moderate diurnal and seasonal variation (mean winter minima rarely &lt;10°C except in subtropical transitional zones). Soils are moist but not regularly inundated or peaty (see TF1.3) Most nutrient capital is sequestered in vegetation or cycled through the dynamic litter layer, critical for retaining nutrients that would otherwise be leached or lost to runoff.
In some coastal regions outside equatorial latitudes (mostly &gt;10° and excluding extensive forests in continental America and Africa), decadal regimes of tropical storms drive cycles of canopy destruction and renewal.

## DISTRIBUTION

Humid tropical and subtropical regions in Central and West Africa, Southeast Asia, Oceania, northeast Australia, Central and tropical South America and the Caribbean.

# T1.2 Tropical subtropical dry forests and thickets

BIOME: TROPICAL-SUBTROPICAL
FORESTS REALM: TERRESTRIAL

Contributors: R.T. Pennington, J. Franklin, N.A. Brummitt, A. Etter, K.R. Young, R.T. Corlett, D.A. Keith

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These closed-canopy forests and thickets have drought-deciduous or semi-deciduous phenology in at least some woody plants (rarely fully evergreen), and
thus seasonally high LAI. Strongly seasonal photoautotrophic productivity is limited by a regular annual water deficit/surplus cycle. Diversity is lower across most taxa than T1.1, but tree and vertebrate diversity is high relative to most other forest systems. Plant growth forms and leaf sizes are less diverse
than in T1.1. Grasses are rare or absent, except on savanna ecotones, due to canopy shading and/or water competition, while epiphytes, ferns, bryophytes and forbs are present but limited by seasonal drought. Trophic networks are complex
with low exclusivity and diverse representation of herbivorous, frugivorous, and carnivorous vertebrates. Fungi and other microbes are important decomposers of abundant leaf litter. Many woody plants are dispersed by wind and some by vertebrates. Most nutrient capital is sequestered in vegetation or cycled through the litter layer. Trees typically have thin bark and low fire tolerance and can recruit in shaded microsites. Plants are tolerant of seasonal drought but can exploit moisture when it is seasonally available through high SLA and plastic productivity. Gap-phase dynamics are driven primarily by individual tree-fall and exploited by seedling banks and vines (seedbanks are uncommon). These forests may be involved in fire-regulated stable-state dynamics with savannas.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Overall water surplus (or small deficit &lt;100 mm), but a substantial seasonal deficit
in winter in which little or no rain falls within a 4–7-month period. Warm temperatures (minima rarely &lt;10°C) with low- moderate diurnal and seasonal variability in the tropics, but greater seasonal variability in subtropical continental areas. Diverse substrates generally produce high levels of nutrients. Tropical storms may be important disturbances in some areas but flammability is low due to limited ground fuels except on savanna ecotones.

## DISTRIBUTION

Seasonally dry tropical and subtropical regions in Central and West Africa, Madagascar, southern Asia, north and northern and eastern Australia, the Pacific, Central and South America and the Caribbean.

# T1.3 Tropical-subtropical montane rainforests

BIOME: TROPICAL-SUBTROPICAL FORESTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Closed-canopy evergreen forests on tropical mountains usually have a single-layer low tree canopy (~5–20 m tall) with small leaf sizes (microphyll-notophyll) and high SLA. They transition to lowland rainforests (T1.1) with decreasing altitude and to warm temperate forests (T2.4)
at subtropical latitudes. Structure and taxonomic diversity become more diminutive and simpler with altitude, culminating in elfinwood forms. Conspicuous epiphytic ferns, bryophytes, lichens, orchids and bromeliads drape tree branches and exploit atmospheric moisture (cloud stripping), but grasses are rare or absent, except for bamboos in some areas. Moderate productivity is fuelled by autochthonous energy, limited by cool temperatures, possibly by high exposure to UV-B radiation, and sometimes by shallow soil and/or wind exposure. Growth and reproductive phenology is usually seasonal. Plant propagules are dispersed mostly by wind and territorial birds and mammals. Taxonomic diversity is moderate to low, especially in the tree canopy, but there is often high local endemism at higher altitudes in most groups, especially amphibians, birds, plants and invertebrates. Gap-phase dynamics are driven by individual tree-fall or lightning strikes, more rarely by extreme wind storms in some areas. Seedling banks are common (seedbanks are uncommon) and most plants are shade tolerant and can recruit in the shade.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Substantial cloud moisture and high humidity underpin a reliable year-round rainfall surplus over evapotranspiration. Altitudinal gradients in temperature, precipitation and exposure are pivotal in ecosystem structure and function. Frequent cloud cover from orographic uplift
and closed tree canopies maintain a moist microclimate and shady conditions. Temperatures are mild-cool with occasional frost. Seasonal variability is low-moderate but diurnal variability is moderate-high. Winter monthly mean minima may be around 0°C in some areas. Landslides are a significant
form of disturbance that drive successional dynamics on steep slopes and is exacerbated by extreme rainfall events.
Mountains experience elevated UV-B radiation with altitude and, in some regions, are exposed to local or regional storms.

## DISTRIBUTION

Humid tropical and subtropical regions in East Africa, East Madagascar, Southeast Asia, west Oceania, northeast Australia, Central and tropical South America.

# T1.4 Tropical heath forests

BIOME: TROPICAL-SUBTROPICAL FORESTS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Structurally simple evergreen
forests with closed to open canopies, typically 5–20 m tall
and uniform with a moderate to high LAI. Productivity is lower than in other tropical forests, weakly seasonal and limited
by nutrient availability and in some cases by soil anoxia, but decomposition rates are high. Plant traits, such as insectivory and N-fixing microbial associations, are well represented, suggesting adaptive responses to nitrogen deficiency. Aside from plant insectivory, trophic networks are simple compared
to other tropical forests. Diversity of plant and animal taxa is
also relatively low, but endemism is proportionately high. Tree foliage is characterised by small (microphyll-notophyll) leaves with lower SLA than other tropical forests. Leaves are leathery and often ascending vertically, enabling more light penetration to ground level than in other tropical forests. Tree stems are slender (generally &lt;20 cm in diameter), sometimes twisted, and often densely packed and without buttresses. Epiphytes are usually abundant but lianas are rare and ground vegetation is sparse, with the forest floor dominated by insectivorous vascular plants and bryophytes.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

These forests experience
an overall water surplus, but productivity is limited by deep sandy low-nutrient acidic substrates, which are leached by high rainfall. Most nutrients are retained in the vegetation. Downward movement of clay and organic particles through the soil profile results in a deep, white sandy horizon capped by a thin grey surface horizon (typical of podzols), limiting the capacity of the soil to retain nutrients (especially nitrogen) and moisture within the shallow rooting zone. Hence they are prone to inter-annual droughts, but waterlogging may occur where the water table
is close to the surface, resulting in periodic anoxia within the root zone. Landscape water-table gradients result in surface mosaics in which heath forests may be juxtaposed with more waterlogged peat forests (TF1.1) and palustrine wetland systems (TF1.4).

## DISTRIBUTION

Scattered through northwest and west Amazonia, possibly Guyana, and Southeast Asia, notably in the Rio Negro catchment and southern Kalimantan. Not known in Africa, but possibly in the Congo region.
