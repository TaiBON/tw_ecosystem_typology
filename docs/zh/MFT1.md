# MFT1 Brackish tidal biome

The Brackish tidal systems biome is associated with prograding depositional shorelines at the interface of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. The relative influences of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial processes vary from strongly fluvial deltas to marine-dominated intertidal forests and terrestrial-dominated coastal saltmarsh. Autochthonous sources of energy, contributed by flowering plants and algae, are supplemented
by allochthonous sources delivered by rivers, currents, and tides. These sources support high productivity and complex trophic webs that include highly mobile fish and birds that rely on brackish tidal systems to complete their lifecycles. Standing plants assimilate energy and engineer habitat structure for epifauna and epiflora as well as juvenile fish nurseries. They also promote sediment deposition by dampening wave and tidal energy. While terrestrial systems are the ultimate source of most sediment, fluvial and marine processes redistribute it and drive
patch dynamics across temporal and spatial scales. Brackish tidal systems are structured by steep local gradients in salinity and tidal exposure. Physiological traits that confer differential fitness and competitive abilities, together with differential predation pressure, mediate species turnover along gradients. Brackish tidal systems are distributed on depositional coastlines throughout the world.

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Coastal river deltas are prograding depositional systems, shaped by freshwater flows and influenced by wave and tidal flow regimes and substrate composition. The biota of these ecosystems reflects strong relationships with terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms at different spatial scales. Consequently, they typically occur as multi-scale mosaics comprised of unique elements juxtaposed with other functional groups that extend far beyond the deltaic influence, such as floodplain marshes (TF1.4), mangroves (MFT1.2), sandy shorelines (MT1.3) and subtidal muddy plains (M1.8). Gradients of water submergence and salinity structure these mosaics. Allochthonous subsidies from riverine discharge and marine currents supplement autochthonous sources of energy and carbon and contribute to high productivity. Complex, multi-faceted trophic relationships reflect the convergence and integration of three contrasting realms and the resulting niche diversity. Autotrophs include planktonic algae and emergent and submerged aquatic plants, which contribute to trophic networks mostly through organic detritus (rather than herbivory). Soft sediments and flowing water are critical to in-sediment fauna dominated by polychaetes and molluscs. Freshwater, estuarine, and marine fish and zooplankton are diverse and abundant in the water column. These provide food for diverse communities of wading and fishing birds, itinerant marine predators and terrestrial scavengers and predators (e.g. mammals and reptiles). Virtually all biota have life-history and/or movement traits enabling them to exploit highly dynamic ecosystem structures and disturbance regimes. High rates of turnover in habitat and biota are expressed spatially by large fluctuations in the mosaic of patch types that make up deltaic ecosystems.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

River inflows structure the dynamic mosaics of coastal river deltas. Inflows depend on catchment geomorphology and climate and influence water levels, nutrient input, turbidity (hence light penetration), tidal amplitude, salinity gradients, temperature, dissolved oxygen and organic carbon. Rates of delta aggradation depend on interactions among riverine sedimentation and ocean currents, tides and wave action, which disperse sediment loads. Coastal geomorphology influences depth gradients. These processes result in complex, spatio-temporally variable mosaics of distributary channels, islands, floodplains, mangroves, subtidal mud plains and sand beds. Regimes of floods and storm surges driven by weather in the river catchment and ocean, respectively, have a profound impact on patch dynamics.

## DISTRIBUTION

Continental margins where rivers connect the coast to high-rainfall catchments, usually with high mountains in their headwaters.

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Mangroves are structural engineers and possess traits, including pneumatophores, salt excretion glands, vivipary and propagule buoyancy, that promote survival and recruitment in poorly aerated, saline, mobile and tidally inundated substrates. They are highly efficient in nitrogen use efficiency and nutrient resorption. These systems are among the most productive coastal environments. They produce large amounts of detritus (e.g. leaves, twigs and bark), which is
either buried in waterlogged sediments, consumed by crabs, or more commonly decomposed by fungi and bacteria, mobilising carbon and nutrients to higher trophic levels. These ecosystems are also major blue carbon sinks, incorporating organic matter into sediments and living biomass. Although highly productive, these ecosystems are less speciose than other coastal
biogenic systems. Crabs are among the most abundant and important invertebrates. Their burrows oxygenate sediments, enhance groundwater penetration, and provide habitat for other invertebrates such as molluscs and worms. Specialised roots (pneumatophores and stilt roots) provide a complex habitat structure that protects juvenile fish from predators and serves as hard substrate for the attachment of algae as well as sessile and mobile invertebrates (e.g. oysters, mussels, sponges
and gastropods). Mangrove canopies support invertebrate herbivores and other terrestrial biota, including invertebrates, reptiles, small mammals and extensive bird communities. These are highly dynamic systems, with species distributions adjusting to local changes in sediment distribution, tidal regimes, and local inundation and salinity gradients.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Mangroves are physiologically intolerant of low temperatures, which excludes them from regions where mean air temperature during the coldest months is -20°C, where the seasonal temperature range exceeds
10°C, or where ground frost occurs. Many mangrove soils are low in nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. Limited availability of nitrogen and phosphorus Regional distributions are influenced by interactions among landscape position, rainfall, hydrology, sea level, sediment dynamics, subsidence, storm- driven processes and disturbance by pests and predators. Rainfall and sediment supply from rivers and currents promote mangrove establishment and persistence, while waves and
large tidal currents destabilise and erode mangrove substrates, mediating local-scale dynamics in ecosystem distributions. High rainfall reduces salinity stress and increases nutrient loading from adjacent catchments, while tidal flushing also regulates salinity.

## DISTRIBUTION

Widely distributed along tropical and warm temperate coastlines of the world. Large-scale currents may prevent buoyant seeds from reaching some areas.

# MFT1.3 Coastal saltmarshes and reedbeds

BIOME: MFT1 BRACKISH TIDAL SYSTEMS
REALM: TRANSITIONAL TERRESTRIAL-FRESHWATER-MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Coastal saltmarshes are vegetated by salt-tolerant forbs, grasses and shrubs, with fine-scale mosaics related to strong local hydrological and salinity gradients, as well as competition and facilitation. Plant traits, such as succulence, salt excretion, osmotic regulation, reduced transpiration, C4 photosynthesis (among grasses), modular growth forms and aerenchymatous tissues, confer varied degrees of tolerance to salinity, desiccation and substrate anoxia. Adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems influence the complexity and function of the trophic network, while freshwater inputs mediate resource availability and physiological stress. Angiosperms are structurally dominant autotrophs, but algal mats and phytoplankton imported by tidal waters contribute to primary production. Cyanobacteria and rhizobial bacteria are important N-fixers. Tides and runoff bring subsidies of organic detritus and nutrients (including nitrates) from marine and terrestrial sources, respectively. Nitrogen is imported into saltmarshes mainly as inorganic forms and exported largely as organic forms, providing important subsidies to the trophic networks of adjacent estuarine fish nurseries (FM1.2). Fungi and bacteria decompose dissolved and particulate organic matter, while sulphate-reducing bacteria are important in the decay of substantial biomass in the anaerobic subsoil. Protozoans consume microbial decomposers, while in situ detritivores and herbivores include a range of crustaceans, polychaetes and molluscs. Many of these ingest a mixture
of organic material and sediment, structuring, aerating, and increasing the micro-scale heterogeneity of the substrate
with burrows and faecal pellets. Fish move through saltmarsh vegetation at high tide, feeding mainly on algae. They include small-bodied residents and juveniles of larger species that then move offshore. Itinerant terrestrial mammals consume higher plants, regulating competition and vegetation structure. Colonial and solitary shorebirds breed and/or forage in saltmarsh. Migratory species that play important roles in the dispersal of plants, invertebrates and microbes, while abundant foragers may force top-down transformational change.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

High and variable salt concentration is driven by alternating episodes of soil desiccation and flushing, associated with cycles of tidal inundation and drying combined with freshwater seepage, rainfall and runoff in the upper intertidal zone. These interacting processes produce dynamic fine-scale hydrological and salinity gradients, which may drive transformation to intertidal forests (MFT1.2). Marshes are associated with low-energy depositional coasts but may occur on sea cliffs and headlands where wind deposits salt from wave splash (i.e. salt spray) and aerosol inputs. Salt approaches hypersaline levels where flushing events are infrequent. Other nutrients make up a low proportion of the total ionic content. Subsoils are generally anaerobic, but this varies depending on seepage water and the frequency of tidal inundation. Tidal cycles also influence temperature extremes, irregularities in photoperiod, physical disturbance and deposition of sediment.

## DISTRIBUTION

Widely distributed, mostly on low-energy coasts from arctic to tropical and subantarctic latitudes.
