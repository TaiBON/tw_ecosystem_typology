# M2 Pelagic ocean waters biome

The Pelagic ocean biome is the largest on earth, comprising
the open-ocean water column across all latitudes. Diversity
is highest in near-surface layers, particularly in niche habitats
at water-mass boundaries where contrasting communities overlap. The depth gradient strongly structures the availability
of light (and hence constraints on primary producers and visual predators), nutrients and organic carbon, and differentiates functional groups within the biome. Primary production is limited to the uppermost, euphotic, epipelagic zone, while deeper layers depend on allochthonous fluxes of carbon from above
via sedimentation or vertically migrating organisms. This flux is diminished by consumers as it falls to deeper layers, resulting
in low productivity and low diversity at the greatest depths. A consistent Redfield ratio (C:N:P) throughout the oceans marks feedbacks between planktonic biota and ocean chemistry, with deviations often attributable to nutrient deficiency. Iron and silica concentrations may also be limiting in some waters. Latitudinal
variation in productivity relates to the local characteristics of the water column, such as temperature, mixing and availability of nutrients and light. Migration is a common characteristic in this biome, both horizontal between feeding and breeding areas, and diel or ontogenetic vertical migrations, such as that between the refuge provided by the low-light environment in the mesopelagic zone and the productive, upper epipelagic zone with its associated visual predators. Organisms in each depth zone display adaptations to the light environment. Bioluminescence is common in mesopelagic species, while species found at greater, aphotic depths may have enhanced sensory organs.

# M2.1 Epipelagic ocean waters

BIOME: M2 PELAGIC OCEAN WATERS
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

The epipelagic or euphotic zone of the open ocean is the uppermost layer that is penetrated by enough light to support photosynthesis. The vast area of the ocean means that autochthonous productivity in the epipelagic layer, largely by diatoms, accounts for around half of all global carbon fixation. This in turn supports a complex trophic network and high biomass of diatoms, copepods (resident and vertical migrants), fish, cephalopods, marine mammals and seabirds, including fast-swimming visual predators taking advantage
of the high-light environment. The suitability of conditions for recruitment and reproduction depends on the characteristics of the water column, which vary spatially and impact productivity rates, species composition, and community size structure. Mid-ocean subtropical gyres, for example, are characteristically oligotrophic, with lower productivity than other parts of the ocean surface. In contrast to the rest of the epipelagic zone, upwelling zones are characterised by specific patterns of water movement that drive high nutrient levels, productivity and abundant
forage fish, and are therefore included in a different functional group (M1.9). Seasonal variation in productivity is greater at
high latitudes due to lower light penetration and duration in winter compared to summer. The habitat and lifecycle of some specialised pelagic species (e.g. herbivorous copepods, flying fish) are entirely contained within epipelagic ocean waters, but many commonly occurring crustaceans, fish and cephalopods undertake either diel or ontogenetic vertical migration between the epipelagic and deeper oceanic layers. These organisms exploit the food available in the productive epipelagic zone either at night (when predation risk is lower) or for the entirety of their less mobile, juvenile life stages. Horizontal migration is also common and some species (e.g. tuna and migratory whales) swim long distances to feed and reproduce. Other species use horizontal currents for passive migration, particularly smaller planktonic organisms or life stages (e.g. copepods and small pelagic fish larvae) moving between spawning and feeding grounds. Unconsumed plankton and dead organisms sink from this upper oceanic zone, providing an important particulate source of nutrients to deeper, aphotic zones.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

The epipelagic zone is structured by a strong depth gradient in light, which varies seasonally at high latitudes. Light also varies with local turbidity, but at lower latitudes may extend to ~200 m where light attenuates to 1% of surface levels. Interaction at the surface between the ocean and atmosphere leads to increased seasonality, mixing and warming, and makes this the most biologically and physicochemically variable ocean layer. Nutrient levels are spatially variable as a result. Salinity varies with terrestrial freshwater inputs, evaporation and mixing, with greater variation in semi-enclosed areas (i.e. the Mediterranean Sea) than the open ocean.

## DISTRIBUTION

The surface layer of the entire open ocean beyond the near-shore zone.

# M2.2 Mesopelagic ocean waters

BIOME: M2 PELAGIC OCEAN WATERS
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

The mesopelagic, dysphotic,
or ‘twilight’ zone, begins below the epipelagic layer and
receives enough light to discern diurnal cycles but too little for photosynthesis. The trophic network is therefore dominated
by detritivores and predators. The diverse organisms within
this layer consume and reprocess allochthonous organic material sinking from the upper, photosynthetic layer. Hence, upper mesopelagic waters include layers of concentrated plankton, bacteria and other organic matter sinking from the heterogeneous epipelagic zone (M2.1). Consumers of this material, including detritivorous copepods, deplete oxygen levels in the mesopelagic zone more so than in other layers where oxygen can be replenished via diffusion and mixing at
the surface or photosynthesis (as in the epipelagic zone), or where lower particulate nutrient levels limit biological processes (as in the deeper layers). Many species undertake diel vertical migration into the epipelagic zone during the night to feed when predation risk is lower. These organisms use the mesopelagic zone as a refuge during the day and increase the flow of carbon between ocean layers. Bioluminescence is a common trait present in more than 90% of mesopelagic organisms often
with silvery reflective skin (i.e. lantern fish). Fish in the lower mesopelagic zone (&gt;700 m) are less reflective and mobile due to reduced selection pressure from visual predators in low light conditions. These systems are difficult to sample, but advances in estimating fish abundances indicate that biomass is very high, possibly two orders of magnitude larger than global fisheries landings ($1 \times 10^{10}$ t).

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Nutrient and energy availability depend on allochthonous fluxes of carbon from the upper ocean. Energy assimilation from sunlight is negligible. This is characteristically episodic and linked to events
in the epipelagic zone. Buffered from surface forcing by epipelagic waters, the mesopelagic zone is less spatially and temporally variable, but the interface between the two zones is characterised by heterogeneous regions with greater biotic diversity. Areas of physicochemical discontinuity (e.g. current and water-mass boundaries and eddies) also result in niche habitats with increased local diversity. Oxygen minimum zones are formed in mesopelagic waters when biological activity reduces oxygen levels in a water mass that is then restricted from mixing by physical processes or features. Oxygen minimum zones support specialised biota and have high levels of biological activity around their borders.

## DISTRIBUTION

Global oceans from a depth of ~200 m or where &lt;1% of light penetrates, down to 1,000 m.

# M2.3 Bathypelagic ocean waters

BIOME: M2 PELAGIC OCEAN WATERS
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These are deep, open-ocean ecosystems in the water column, generally between 1,000– 3,000 m in depth. Energy sources are allochthonous, derived mainly from the fallout of particulate organic matter from the epipelagic horizon (M2.1). Total biomass declines exponentially from an average of 1.45 mg.C.m-3 at 1,000 m deep to 0.16 mg.C.m-3 at 3,000 m. Trophic structure is truncated, with
no primary producers. Instead, the major components are zooplankton, micro-crustaceans (i.e. shrimps), medusozoans (i.e. jellyfish), cephalopods and four main guilds of fish (gelativores, zooplanktivores, micronektivores and generalists). These organisms generally do not migrate vertically, in contrast to those in the mesopelagic zone (M2.2). Larvae often hatch from buoyant egg masses at the surface to take advantage of food sources. Long generation lengths (&gt;20 years in most fish) and low fecundity reflect low energy availability. Fauna typically have low metabolic rates, with bathypelagic fish having rates
of oxygen consumption ~10% of that of epipelagic fish. Fish
are consequently slow swimmers with high water content in muscles and relatively low red-to-white muscle tissue ratios. They also have low-density bodies, reduced skeletons and/or specialised buoyancy organs to achieve neutral buoyancy for specific depth ranges. Traits related to the lack of light include reduced eyes, lack of pigmentation, and enhanced vibratory and chemosensory organs. Some planktonic forms, medusas and fish have internal light organs that produce intrinsic or bacterial bioluminescence to attract prey items or mates or to defend themselves. Most of the biota possess cell membranes with specialised phospholipid composition, intrinsic protein modifications and protective osmolytes (i.e. organic compounds that influence the properties of biological fluids) to optimise protein function at high pressure.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

No light penetrates from the ocean surface to bathypelagic waters. Oxygen concentrations are not limiting to aerobic respiration (mostly $3–7 mL \cdot L^{-1}$) and are recharged through thermohaline circulation by cooling Oxygenated water is circulated globally from two zones (the Weddell Sea and the far North Atlantic Ocean) where ice formation and surface cooling create high-salinity, oxygenated water that sinks and is subsequently circulated globally via the ‘great ocean conveyor’. Re-oxygenation frequency varies from 300 to 1,000 years, depending on the circulation route. More local thermohaline circulation occurs by evaporation in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, resulting in warm temperatures (13–15°C) at great depths. Otherwise, bathypelagic temperatures vary from −1°C in polar waters to 2–4°C in tropical and temperate waters. Nutrient levels are low and derive from the fall of organic remains from surface horizons. Pressure varies with depth from 100 to 300 atmospheres.

## DISTRIBUTION

All oceans and deep seas beyond the continental slope and deeper than 1,000 m.

# M2.4 Abyssopelagic ocean waters

BIOME: M2 PELAGIC OCEAN WATERS
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These deep, open-ocean ecosystems span depths from 3,000 to 6,000 m. Autotrophs are absent and energy sources are entirely allochthonous. Particulate organic debris is imported principally from epipelagic horizons (M2.1) and the flux of matter diminishing through
the mesopelagic zone (M2.2) and bathypelagic zone (M2.3). Food for heterotrophs is therefore very scarce. Due to extreme conditions and limited resources, biodiversity is very low.
Total biomass declines exponentially from an average of 0.16 $mg \cdot C \cdot m^{-3}$ at 3,000 m deep
to 0.0058 $mg \cdot C m^{-3}$ at 6,000 m. However, there is an order of magnitude variation around the mean due to regional differences in the productivity of surface waters. Truncated trophic networks are dominated by planktonic detritivores, with low densities of gelatinous invertebrates
and scavenging and predatory fish. Fauna typically have low metabolic rates and some have internal light organs that produce bioluminescence to attract prey or mates or to defend themselves. Vertebrates typically have reduced skeletons
and watery tissues to maintain buoyancy. Most of the biota possesses cell membranes with specialised phospholipid composition, intrinsic protein modifications and protective osmolytes (i.e. organic compounds that influence the properties of biological fluids) to optimise protein function at high pressure.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

No light penetrates
from the ocean surface to abyssopelagic waters.
Nutrient concentrations are very low and recharge is dependent on organic
flux and detrital fall from the epipelagic zone. Oxygen concentrations,
however, are not limiting to aerobic respiration (mostly $3–7 mL \cdot L^{-1}$) and are generally recharged through global thermohaline circulation driven by cooling in polar regions. Water temperatures vary from below zero in polar waters up to 3°C

STRIBUTION: All oceans and the deepest parts of the Mediterranean Sea beyond the continental slope, mid-ocean ridges, and plateaus at depths of 3,000–6,000 m.

# M2.5 Sea ice

BIOME: M2 PELAGIC OCEAN WATERS
REALM: MARINE

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

The seasonally frozen surface of polar oceans (1–2 m thick in the Antarctic and 2–3 m thick
in the Arctic) may be connected to land or permanent ice shelves and is one of the most dynamic ecosystems on earth. Sympagic (i.e. ice-associated) organisms occur in all physical components of the sea-ice system, including the surface, the internal matrix and brine channel system, the underside and nearby waters modified by sea-ice presence. Primary production by microalgal and microbial communities beneath and within
sea ice form the base of the food web, and waters beneath
sea ice develop standing stocks significantly higher than in
ice free areas, despite shading by the ice. These are grazed
by diverse zooplankton, including krill. The sea ice underside provides refuge from surface predators and is an important nursery for juvenile krill and fish. Deepwater fish migrate vertically to feed on zooplankton beneath the sea ice. High secondary production (particularly of krill) in sea ice and around its edges supports seals, seabirds, penguins (in the Antarctic) and baleen whales. The highest trophic levels include vertebrate predators, such as polar bears (in the Arctic), leopard seals and toothed whales. Sea ice also provides resting and/or breeding habitats for pinnipeds (seals), polar bears and penguins. As the sea ice decays annually, it releases biogenic material consumed by grazers and particulate, and dissolved organic matter, nutrients, freshwater and iron, which stimulate phytoplankton growth and have important roles in biogeochemical cycling.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Sea ice is integral to the global climate system and has a crucial influence on pelagic marine ecosystems and biogeochemical processes. Sea ice limits atmosphere-ocean gas and momentum exchanges, regulates sea temperature, reflects solar radiation, acquires snow cover and redistributes freshwater to lower latitudes. The annual retreat of sea ice during spring and summer initiates high phytoplankton productivity at the marginal ice zone and provides a major resource for grazing zooplankton, including krill. Polynyas, where areas of low ice concentration are bounded by high ice concentrations, have very high productivity levels. Most sea ice is pack-ice transported by wind and currents. Fast ice forms a stationary substrate anchored to the coast, icebergs, glaciers and ice shelves and can persist for decades.

## DISTRIBUTION

Arctic Ocean 0–45°N (Japan) or only to 80°N (Spitsbergen). Southern Ocean 55–70°S. At maximum extent, sea ice covers ~5% of the Northern Hemisphere and 8% of the Southern Hemisphere.
