# T4 Savannas and grasslands biome

Ecological functions within the Savannas and grasslands
biome are closely linked to a mostly continuous ground layer of grasses that contribute moderate to very high levels of primary productivity driven by strongly seasonal water surplus and deficit cycles. The timing of the seasonal cycle of productivity varies with latitude and becomes more variable inter-annually as total rainfall declines. The woody component of the vegetation may be completely absent or may vary to a height and stature that resembles that of a forest. In the tropics and subtropics, productivity peaks in the summer when high rainfall coincides with warm temperatures. At temperate latitudes, summer growth is suppressed by water deficits associated with high evapotranspiration, sometimes exacerbated by weakly seasonal (winter-maximum) rainfall, so that productivity peaks in spring when warming temperatures coincide with high soil moisture accumulated over winter. Co-existence between trees and grasses and between grasses and interstitial forbs is mediated
by herbivory and/or fire. These agents are critical in the top- down regulation of grassy ecosystems and in some cases are involved in feedback mechanisms that mediate regime shifts between alternative stable states. Herbivory is the primary driver in highly fertile and productive systems, whereas fire is the primary driver in less fertile and lower productivity systems. Nutrient gradients are exacerbated volatilisation during fire and the loss of nutrients in smoke. The representation of grass species with C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways varies with water availability and temperature over regional and continental climatic gradients. Grasses are rapid responders to seasonal pulses of elevated soil moisture and sustain a complex trophic web with large-bodied mammalian herbivores and their predators. The curing of grasses over the dry season is critical to flammability. Mammal diversity, trophic complexity, and the expression of physical and chemical defences against herbivory also vary with soil fertility.

# T4.1 Trophic savannas

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These grassy woodlands and grasslands are dominated by C4 grasses with stoloniferous, rhizomatous and tussock growth forms that are kept short by vertebrate grazers. Trophic savannas (relative to pyric savannas, T4.2) have unique plant and animal diversity within a complex trophic structure dominated by abundant mammalian herbivores and predators. These animals are functionally differentiated in body size, mouth morphology, diet and behaviour. They promote fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity and dominance of short grass species, sustaining the system through positive feedbacks and limiting fire fuels. Trees and grasses possess functional traits that promote tolerance to chronic herbivory as well as seasonal drought. Seasonal high productivity coincides with summer rains. The dry season induces grass curing and leaf fall in deciduous and semi-deciduous woody plants. Trees are shade- intolerant during their establishment and most develop chemical (i.e. phenolics) or physical (i.e. spinescence) herbivory defence traits and an ability to re-sprout as they enter the juvenile phase. Their soft microphyll-notophyll foliage has relatively high SLA and low C:N ratios, as do grasses. Robust root systems and stolons/ rhizomes enable characteristic grasses to survive and spread under heavy grazing. As well as vertebrate herbivores and predators, vertebrate scavengers and invertebrate detritivores are key components of the trophic network and carbon cycle. Nitrogen fixation, recycling and deposition by animals exceed volatilisation.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Trophic savannas like pyric savannas are driven by seasonal climates but generally occupy environmental niches with lower rainfall and higher soil fertility. High annual rainfall deficit of 400 mm to &gt;1,800 mm. Annual rainfall generally varies from 300 mm to 700 mm, always with strong seasonal (winter) drought, but these savanna types
are restricted to landscapes with sufficient water bodies (rivers and lakes) to sustain high densities of large mammals. Temperatures are warm-hot with low-moderate variability through the year. Low intensity fires have return intervals of 5–50 years, depending on animal densities and inter-annual rainfall variation, usually after the growing season, removing much of the remaining biomass not consumed by herbivores. Soils are moderately fertile and often have a significant clay component.

## DISTRIBUTION

Seasonal tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia.

# T4.2 Pyric tussock savannas

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Grassy woodlands and grasslands are dominated by C4 tussock grasses, with some C3 grasses in the Americas and variable tree cover. In the tropics, seasonally high productivity coincides with the timing of summer rains
and grasses cure in dry winters, promoting flammability. This pattern also occurs in the subtropics but transitions occur with temperate woodlands (T4.4), which have different seasonal phenology, tree and grass dominance and fire regimes. Tree basal area, abundance of plants with annual semelparous life cycles and abundant grasses with tall tussock growth forms are strongly dependent on mean annual rainfall (i.e. limited
by seasonal drought). Local endemism is low across all taxa
but regional endemism is high, especially in the Americas and Australasia. Plant traits, such as deciduous leaf phenology or deep roots, promote tolerance to seasonal drought and rapid resource exploitation. Woody plants have microphyll-notophyll foliage with moderate-high SLA and mostly high C:N ratios. Some C4 grasses nonetheless accumulate high levels of rubisco, which may push down C:N ratios. Nitrogen volatilisation exceeds deposition because fire is the major consumer of biomass. Woody plant species are shade-intolerant during their establishment and develop fire-resistant organs (e.g. thick bark and below-ground bud banks). The contiguous ground layer
of erect tussock grasses creates an aerated flammable fuel bed, while grass architecture with tightly clustered culms vents heat away from meristems. Patchy fires promote landscape- scale vegetation heterogeneity (i.e. in tree cover) and maintain the dominance of flammable tussock grasses over shrubs, especially in wetter climates, and hence sustain the system through positive feedbacks. Fires also enhance efficiency of predators. Vertebrate scavengers and invertebrate detritivores are key components of the trophic network and carbon cycle. Mammalian herbivores and predators are present but exert less top-down influence on the diverse trophic structure than fire. Consequently, plant physical defences against herbivores, such as spinescence, are less prominent than in T4.1.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

An overall rainfall deficit up
to ~1,200 mm or a modest surplus of up to 500 mm, always with strong seasonal (winter) drought with continuously warm- hot temperatures through the year even though rainfall become less seasonal in the subtropics. Mean annual rainfall varies from 650 mm to 1,500 mm. Sub-decadal fire regimes of surface fires occur throughout the dry season, while canopy fires occur rarely late in the dry season. Soils are of low-moderate fertility, often with high Fe and Al.

## DISTRIBUTION

Seasonally dry tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Australia, Asia, and Africa.

# T4.3 Hummock savannas

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These open woodlands are dominated by C4 hummock grasses (C3 and stoloniferous grasses are absent) with sclerophyllous trees and shrubs. Their primary productivity is lower and less regularly seasonal than in other savannas of the subtropics (T4.1 and T4.2),
but the seasonal peak nonetheless coincides with summer monsoonal rains. Plant traits promote tolerance to seasonal drought, including reduced leaf surfaces, thick cuticles,
sunken stomata and deep root architecture to access subsoil moisture. Deciduous leaf phenology is less common than in other savannas, likely due to selection pressure for nutrient conservation associated with oligotrophic substrates. A major feature distinguishing this group of savannas from others is its ground layer of slow-growing sclerophyllous, spiny, domed hummock grasses interspersed with bare ground. Woody biomass and LAI decline along rainfall gradients. Sclerophyll shrubs and trees are shade-intolerant during establishment and most possess fire-resistant organs (e.g. thick bark, epicormic meristematic tissues and below-ground bud banks). Their notophyll foliage and that of hummock grasses has low SLA and mostly high C:N ratios, although N may be elevated in rubisco- enriched C4 grasses. Trophic structure is therefore simpler than in others savannas. Mammalian herbivores and their predators are present in low densities, but fire and invertebrates are the major biomass consumers. Fire promotes landscape-scale vegetation heterogeneity but occurs less frequently than in other savannas due to slow recovery of perennial hummock grass fuels. Nitrogen volatilisation exceeds deposition due to recurring fires.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

Large overall rainfall deficit up to ~2,000 mm, always with a seasonal (winter) drought, but in drier areas seasonality is weaker than in other savanna groups. Mean annual rainfall is generally 400–1,000 mm. Climatic water deficit is exacerbated by coarse-textured, usually shallow, rocky soils. These are characteristically infertile. Temperatures are warm-hot with moderate seasonal and diurnal variability. Fires promoted by flammable hummocks may consume the low tree canopies and occur at variable decadal intervals any time when it is dry, but fire spread depends on ground fuel continuity which is limited by rainfall and rocky terrain.

## DISTRIBUTION

Rocky areas of the seasonal Australian tropics, extending to the semi-arid zone.

# T4.4 Temperate woodlands

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

These structurally simple woodlands are characterised by space between open tree crowns
and a ground layer with tussock grasses, interstitial forbs,
and a variable shrub component. Grasses with C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways are common, but C4 grasses may be absent from the coldest and wettest sites or where rain rarely falls in the summer. In any given area, C4 grasses are most abundant in summer or on dry sites or areas with summer- dominant rainfall, while C3 grasses predominate in winter, locally moist sites, cold sites, or areas without summer rainfall. The ground flora also varies inter-annually depending on rainfall. Trees generate spatial heterogeneity in light, water and nutrients, which underpin a diversity of microhabitats and mediate competitive interactions among plants in the ground layer. Foliage is mostly microphyll and evergreen (but transmitting abundant light) or deciduous in colder climates. Diversity of plant and invertebrate groups may therefore be relatively high at local scales, but local endemism is limited due to long-distance dispersal. Productivity is relatively high as grasses rapidly produce biomass rich in N and other nutrients after rains. This sustains a relatively complex trophic network of invertebrate
and vertebrate consumers. Large herbivores and their predators are important top-down regulators. Bioturbation by fossorial mammals influences soil structure, water infiltration, and nutrient cycling. The fauna is less functionally and taxonomically diverse than in most tropical savannas (T4.1 and T4.2), but includes large and small mammals, reptiles and a high diversity of birds and macro-invertebrates, including grasshoppers, which are major consumers of biomass. Plants and animals tolerate and persist through periodic ground fires that consume cured-
grass fuels, but few have specialised traits cued to fire (cf. pyric ecosystems such as T2.6).

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

A water deficit occurs seasonally in summer, driven primarily by peak evapotranspiration under warm-hot temperatures and, in some regions, seasonal (winter-maximum) rainfall patterns. Mean annual rainfall is 350–1,000 mm. Low winter temperatures and occasional frost and snow may limit the growing season to 6–9 months. Soils are usually fine-textured and fertile, but N may be limiting in some areas. Fires burn, mostly in the ground layers, during the drier summer months at decadal intervals.

## DISTRIBUTION

Temperate southeast and southwest Australia, Patagonia and Pampas of South America, western and eastern North America, the Mediterranean region, and temperate Eurasia.

# T4.5 Temperate subhumid grasslands

BIOME: T4 SAVANNAS & GRASSLANDS
REALM: TERRESTRIAL

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

Structurally simple tussock grasslands with interstitial forbs occur in subhumid temperate climates. Isolated trees or shrubs may be present in very low densities, but are generally excluded by heavy soil texture, summer drought, winter frost, or recurring summer fires.
Unlike tropical savannas (T4.1–T4.3), these systems are characterised by a mixture of both C3 and C4 grasses, with
C4 grasses most abundant in summer or on dry sites and
C3 grasses predominating in winter or locally moist sites.
There are also strong latitudinal gradients, with C3 grasses
more dominant towards the poles. Diversity of plant and invertebrate groups may be high at small spatial scales, but local endemism is limited due to long-distance dispersal. Productivity is high as grasses rapidly produce biomass rich
in N and other nutrients after rains. This sustains a complex trophic network in which large herbivores and their predators are important top-down regulators. Fossorial mammals are important in bioturbation and nutrient cycling. Mammals are less functionally and taxonomically diverse than in most savannas. Taxonomic affinities vary among regions (e.g. ungulates, cervids, macropods and camelids), but their life history and dietary traits are convergent. Where grazing is not intense and fire occurs infrequently, leaf litter accumulates from the tussocks, creating
a thatch that is important habitat for ground-nesting birds,
small mammals, reptiles and macro-invertebrates, including grasshoppers, which are major consumers of plant biomass. Dense thatch limits productivity. Plant competition plays a
major role in structuring the ecosystem and its dynamics,
with evidence that it is mediated by resource ratios and stress gradients, herbivory and fire regimes. Large herbivores and fires both interrupt competition and promote coexistence of tussocks and interstitial forbs.

## KEY ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS

A strong seasonal water deficit in summer driven by peak evapotranspiration under warm-hot temperatures, despite an unseasonal or weakly seasonal rainfall pattern. Mean annual rainfall varies from 250 mm to 750 mm. Cold winter temperatures limit the growing season to 5–7 months, with frost and snow frequent in continental locations. Summers are warm. Soils are deep, fertile and organic and usually fine-textured. Fires ignited by lightning occur in the drier summer months at sub-decadal or decadal intervals.

## DISTRIBUTION

Western Eurasia, northeast Asia, Midwest North America, Patagonia and Pampas regions of South America, southeast Africa, southeast Australia, and southern New Zealand.
